This time delay must be taken into account when setting the notification value.It is therefore recommended to set an exceedance limit slightly lower, if necessary, so that the notification can be sent in time. A data connection is required to receive push notifications. If the smartphone is temporarily without a data connection, you will receive the push notification with a corresponding time delay.All data are unchecked raw data and are provided without any guarantee.

    "descriptionHtml": "Looking for a Jeopardy Buzzer, Family Feud Buzzer, Quiz Bowl Buzzer, Trivia Buzzer, or playing any kind of game where a buzzer is needed to decide who rang in first? This app is a wireless, easy, and free solution, and no WiFi is required for buzzer use! One person plays as a Host, and then up to 20 other devices can join via Bluetooth as Players. This app does NOT contain any questions, but it DOES allow you to add a way to &quot;Buzz In&quot;, award points, and/or keep time to any game which calls for it.<br><br>The first Player to signal shows up as green on both his device and to the Host; the rest of the Players are then locked from answering until the Host clears, awards points, and allows more buzzing.<br><br>You can keep track of scores, and customize the value of right or wrong answers. You can group players into teams, and track scores by both player and by team. You can add optional Bonus Points if your game calls for it. You can even add a Game Timer to know when your game is done! Short on people? One person can serve as both the Player *and* the Host, awarding points while still being able to buzz in!<br><br>EZBuzzer could be used for Pub Trivia, Quiz Bowl / College Bowl, games such as Jeopardy or Family Feud, or classroom activities!   Replace messy wired buzzer systems with ease...or add an impartial judge to your game instead of guessing who was first!<br><br>EZBuzzer works over Bluetooth - no hassle with joining a WiFi network or dropped WiFi signals.  Initial start-up is simple: One person should sign on as a Host or PlayerHost, and then all others as Players.  Players will automatically connect to the Host, and then the fun can begin! As this game is Bluetooth-based, players should be nearby...this is an app to play with your friends or family together! Don&#39;t like ads? You can remove them easily for a small one-time fee.<br><br>Enjoy! Feedback is welcome!",

You can group players into teams, and track scores by both player and by team. You can add optional Bonus Points if your game calls for it.

One person can serve as both the Player *and* the Host, awarding points while still being able to buzz in!<br><br>EZBuzzer could be used for Pub Trivia, Quiz Bowl / College Bowl, games such as Jeopardy or Family Feud, or classroom activities!   Replace messy wired buzzer systems with ease...or add an impartial judge to your game instead of guessing who was first!<br><br>EZBuzzer works over Bluetooth - no hassle with joining a WiFi network or dropped WiFi signals.  Initial start-up is simple: One person should sign on as a Host or PlayerHost, and then all others as Players.  Players will automatically connect to the Host, and then the fun can begin! As this game is Bluetooth-based, players should be nearby...this is an app to play with your friends or family together! Don&#39;t like ads? You can remove them easily for a small one-time fee.<br><br>Enjoy! Feedback is welcome!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Looking for a Jeopardy Buzzer, Family Feud Buzzer, Quiz Bowl Buzzer, Trivia Buzzer, or playing any kind of game where a buzzer is needed to decide who rang in first? This app is a wireless, easy, and free solution, and no WiFi is required for buzzer use! One person plays as a Host, and then up to 20 other devices can join via Bluetooth as Players. This app does NOT contain any questions, but it DOES allow you to add a way to &quot;Buzz In&quot;, award points, and/or keep time to any game which calls for it.<br><br>The first Player to signal shows up as green on both his device and to the Host; the rest of the Players are then locked from answering until the Host clears, awards points, and allows more buzzing.<br><br>You can keep track of scores, and customize the value of right or wrong answers. You can group players into teams, and track scores by both player and by team. You can add optional Bonus Points if your game calls for it. You can even add a Game Timer to know when your game is done! Short on people? One person can serve as both the Player *and* the Host, awarding points while still being able to buzz in!<br><br>EZBuzzer could be used for Pub Trivia, Quiz Bowl / College Bowl, games such as Jeopardy or Family Feud, or classroom activities!   Replace messy wired buzzer systems with ease...or add an impartial judge to your game instead of guessing who was first!<br><br>EZBuzzer works over Bluetooth - no hassle with joining a WiFi network or dropped WiFi signals.  Initial start-up is simple: One person should sign on as a Host or PlayerHost, and then all others as Players.  Players will automatically connect to the Host, and then the fun can begin! As this game is Bluetooth-based, players should be nearby...this is an app to play with your friends or family together! Don&#39;t like ads? You can remove them easily for a small one-time fee.<br><br>Enjoy! Feedback is welcome!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Looking for a Jeopardy Buzzer, Family Feud Buzzer, Quiz Bowl Buzzer, Trivia Buzzer, or playing any kind of game where a buzzer is needed to decide who rang in first? This app is a wireless, easy, and free solution, and no WiFi is required for buzzer use! One person plays as a Host, and then up to 20 other devices can join via Bluetooth as Players. This app does NOT contain any questions, but it DOES allow you to add a way to &quot;Buzz In&quot;, award points, and/or keep time to any game which calls for it.<br><br>The first Player to signal shows up as green on both his device and to the Host; the rest of the Players are then locked from answering until the Host clears, awards points, and allows more buzzing.<br><br>You can keep track of scores, and customize the value of right or wrong answers. You can group players into teams, and track scores by both player and by team. You can add optional Bonus Points if your game calls for it. You can even add a Game Timer to know when your game is done! Short on people? One person can serve as both the Player *and* the Host, awarding points while still being able to buzz in!<br><br>EZBuzzer could be used for Pub Trivia, Quiz Bowl / College Bowl, games such as Jeopardy or Family Feud, or classroom activities!   Replace messy wired buzzer systems with ease...or add an impartial judge to your game instead of guessing who was first!<br><br>EZBuzzer works over Bluetooth - no hassle with joining a WiFi network or dropped WiFi signals.  Initial start-up is simple: One person should sign on as a Host or PlayerHost, and then all others as Players.  Players will automatically connect to the Host, and then the fun can begin! As this game is Bluetooth-based, players should be nearby...this is an app to play with your friends or family together! Don&#39;t like ads? You can remove them easily for a small one-time fee.<br><br>Enjoy! Feedback is welcome!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Looking for a Jeopardy Buzzer, Family Feud Buzzer, Quiz Bowl Buzzer, Trivia Buzzer, or playing any kind of game where a buzzer is needed to decide who rang in first? This app is a wireless, easy, and free solution, and no WiFi is required for buzzer use! One person plays as a Host, and then up to 20 other devices can join via Bluetooth as Players. This app does NOT contain any questions, but it DOES allow you to add a way to &quot;Buzz In&quot;, award points, and/or keep time to any game which calls for it.<br><br>The first Player to signal shows up as green on both his device and to the Host; the rest of the Players are then locked from answering until the Host clears, awards points, and allows more buzzing.<br><br>You can keep track of scores, and customize the value of right or wrong answers. You can group players into teams, and track scores by both player and by team. You can add optional Bonus Points if your game calls for it. You can even add a Game Timer to know when your game is done! Short on people? One person can serve as both the Player *and* the Host, awarding points while still being able to buzz in!<br><br>EZBuzzer could be used for Pub Trivia, Quiz Bowl / College Bowl, games such as Jeopardy or Family Feud, or classroom activities!   Replace messy wired buzzer systems with ease...or add an impartial judge to your game instead of guessing who was first!<br><br>EZBuzzer works over Bluetooth - no hassle with joining a WiFi network or dropped WiFi signals.  Initial start-up is simple: One person should sign on as a Host or PlayerHost, and then all others as Players.  Players will automatically connect to the Host, and then the fun can begin! As this game is Bluetooth-based, players should be nearby...this is an app to play with your friends or family together! Don&#39;t like ads? You can remove them easily for a small one-time fee.<br><br>Enjoy! Feedback is welcome!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Looking for a Jeopardy Buzzer, Family Feud Buzzer, Quiz Bowl Buzzer, Trivia Buzzer, or playing any kind of game where a buzzer is needed to decide who rang in first? This app is a wireless, easy, and free solution, and no WiFi is required for buzzer use! One person plays as a Host, and then up to 20 other devices can join via Bluetooth as Players. This app does NOT contain any questions, but it DOES allow you to add a way to &quot;Buzz In&quot;, award points, and/or keep time to any game which calls for it.<br><br>The first Player to signal shows up as green on both his device and to the Host; the rest of the Players are then locked from answering until the Host clears, awards points, and allows more buzzing.<br><br>You can keep track of scores, and customize the value of right or wrong answers. You can group players into teams, and track scores by both player and by team. You can add optional Bonus Points if your game calls for it. You can even add a Game Timer to know when your game is done! Short on people? One person can serve as both the Player *and* the Host, awarding points while still being able to buzz in!<br><br>EZBuzzer could be used for Pub Trivia, Quiz Bowl / College Bowl, games such as Jeopardy or Family Feud, or classroom activities!   Replace messy wired buzzer systems with ease...or add an impartial judge to your game instead of guessing who was first!<br><br>EZBuzzer works over Bluetooth - no hassle with joining a WiFi network or dropped WiFi signals.  Initial start-up is simple: One person should sign on as a Host or PlayerHost, and then all others as Players.  Players will automatically connect to the Host, and then the fun can begin! As this game is Bluetooth-based, players should be nearby...this is an app to play with your friends or family together! Don&#39;t like ads? You can remove them easily for a small one-time fee.<br><br>EZBuzzer is also available on other platforms, and all versions are compatible and can be used together.<br><br>Enjoy!

    "descriptionHtml": "Looking for a Jeopardy Buzzer, Family Feud Buzzer, Quiz Bowl Buzzer, Trivia Buzzer, or playing any kind of game where a buzzer is needed to decide who rang in first? This app is a wireless, easy, and free solution, and no WiFi is required for buzzer use! One person plays as a Host, and then up to 10 other devices can join via Bluetooth as Players. This app does NOT contain any questions, but it DOES allow you to add a way to &quot;Buzz In&quot;, award points, and/or keep time to any game which calls for it.<br><br>The first Player to signal shows up as green on both his device and to the Host; the rest of the Players are then locked from answering until the Host clears, awards points, and allows more buzzing.<br><br>You can keep track of scores, and customize the value of right or wrong answers. You can group players into teams, and track scores by both player and by team. You can add optional Bonus Points if your game calls for it. You can even add a Game Timer to know when your game is done! Short on people? One person can serve as both the Player *and* the Host, awarding points while still being able to buzz in!<br><br>EZBuzzer could be used for Pub Trivia, Quiz Bowl / College Bowl, games such as Jeopardy or Family Feud, or classroom activities!   Replace messy wired buzzer systems with ease...or add an impartial judge to your game instead of guessing who was first!<br><br>EZBuzzer works over Bluetooth - no hassle with joining a WiFi network or dropped WiFi signals.  Initial start-up is simple: One person should sign on as a Host or PlayerHost, and then all others as Players.  Players will automatically connect to the Host, and then the fun can begin! As this game is Bluetooth-based, players should be nearby...this is an app to play with your friends or family together! Don&#39;t like ads? You can remove them easily for a small one-time fee.<br><br>EZBuzzer is also available on other platforms, and all versions are compatible and can be used together.<br><br>Enjoy!

    "descriptionHtml": "Looking for a Jeopardy Buzzer, Family Feud Buzzer, Quiz Bowl Buzzer, Trivia Buzzer, or playing any kind of game where a buzzer is needed to decide who rang in first? This app is a wireless, easy, and free solution, and no WiFi is required for buzzer use! One person plays as a Host, and then up to 10 other devices can join via Bluetooth as Players. This app does NOT contain any questions, but it DOES allow you to add a way to &quot;Buzz In&quot;, award points, and/or keep time to any game which calls for it.<br><br>The first Player to signal shows up as green on both his device and to the Host; the rest of the Players are then locked from answering until the Host clears, awards points, and allows more buzzing.<br><br>You can keep track of scores, and customize the value of right or wrong answers. You can group players into teams, and track scores by both player and by team. You can add optional Bonus Points if your game calls for it. You can even add a Game Timer to know when your game is done! Short on people? One person can serve as both the Player *and* the Host, awarding points while still being able to buzz in!<br><br>EZBuzzer could be used for Pub Trivia, Quiz Bowl / College Bowl, games such as Jeopardy or Family Feud, or classroom activities!   Replace messy wired buzzer systems with ease...or add an impartial judge to your game instead of guessing who was first!<br><br>EZBuzzer works over Bluetooth - no hassle with joining a WiFi network or dropped WiFi signals.  Initial start-up is simple: One person should sign on as a Host or PlayerHost, and then all others as Players.  Players will automatically connect to the Host, and then the fun can begin! As this game is Bluetooth-based, players should be nearby...this is an app to play with your friends or family together! Don&#39;t like ads? You can remove them easily for a small one-time fee.<br><br>EZBuzzer is also available on other platforms, and all versions are compatible and can be used together.<br><br>Enjoy! Feedback is welcome!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Looking for a Jeopardy Buzzer, Family Feud Buzzer, Quiz Bowl Buzzer, Trivia Buzzer, or playing any kind of game where a buzzer is needed to decide who rang in first? This app is a wireless, easy, and free solution, and no WiFi is required for buzzer use! One person plays as a Host, and then up to 15 other devices can join via Bluetooth as Players. This app does NOT contain any questions, but it DOES allow you to add a way to &quot;Buzz In&quot;, award points, and/or keep time to any game which calls for it.<br><br>The first Player to signal shows up as green on both his device and to the Host; the rest of the Players are then locked from answering until the Host clears, awards points, and allows more buzzing.<br><br>You can keep track of scores, and customize the value of right or wrong answers. You can group players into teams, and track scores by both player and by team. You can add optional Bonus Points if your game calls for it. You can even add a Game Timer to know when your game is done! Short on people? One person can serve as both the Player *and* the Host, awarding points while still being able to buzz in!<br><br>EZBuzzer could be used for Pub Trivia, Quiz Bowl / College Bowl, games such as Jeopardy or Family Feud, or classroom activities!   Replace messy wired buzzer systems with ease...or add an impartial judge to your game instead of guessing who was first!<br><br>EZBuzzer works over Bluetooth - no hassle with joining a WiFi network or dropped WiFi signals.  Initial start-up is simple: One person should sign on as a Host or PlayerHost, and then all others as Players.  Players will automatically connect to the Host, and then the fun can begin! As this game is Bluetooth-based, players should be nearby...this is an app to play with your friends or family together! Don&#39;t like ads? You can remove them easily for a small one-time fee.<br><br>EZBuzzer is also available on other platforms, and all versions are compatible and can be used together.<br><br>Enjoy! Feedback is welcome!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Looking for a Jeopardy Buzzer, Family Feud Buzzer, Quiz Bowl Buzzer, Trivia Buzzer, or playing any kind of game where a buzzer is needed to decide who rang in first? This app is a wireless, easy, and free solution, and no WiFi is required for buzzer use! One person plays as a Host, and then up to 15 other devices can join via Bluetooth as Players. This app does NOT contain any questions, but it DOES allow you to add a way to &quot;Buzz In&quot;, award points, and/or keep time to any game which calls for it.<br><br>The first Player to signal shows up as green on both his device and to the Host; the rest of the Players are then locked from answering until the Host clears, awards points, and allows more buzzing.<br><br>You can keep track of scores, and customize the value of right or wrong answers. You can group players into teams, and track scores by both player and by team. You can add optional Bonus Points if your game calls for it. You can even add a Game Timer to know when your game is done! Short on people? One person can serve as both the Player *and* the Host, awarding points while still being able to buzz in!<br><br>EZBuzzer could be used for Pub Trivia, Quiz Bowl / College Bowl, games such as Jeopardy or Family Feud, or classroom activities!   Replace messy wired buzzer systems with ease...or add an impartial judge to your game instead of guessing who was first!<br><br>EZBuzzer works over Bluetooth - no hassle with joining a WiFi network or dropped WiFi signals.  Initial start-up is simple: One person should sign on as a Host or PlayerHost, and then all others as Players.  Players will automatically connect to the Host, and then the fun can begin! As this game is Bluetooth-based, players should be nearby...this is an app to play with your friends or family together! Don&#39;t like ads? You can remove them easily for a small one-time fee.<br><br>EZBuzzer is also available on other platforms, and all versions are compatible and can be used together.<br><br>Enjoy!

    "descriptionHtml": "Looking for a Jeopardy Buzzer, Family Feud Buzzer, Quiz Bowl Buzzer, Trivia Buzzer, or playing any kind of game where a buzzer is needed to decide who rang in first? This app is a wireless, easy, and free solution, and no WiFi is required for buzzer use! One person plays as a Host, and then up to 15 other devices can join via Bluetooth as Players. This app does NOT contain any questions, but it DOES allow you to add a way to &quot;Buzz In&quot;, award points, and/or keep time to any game which calls for it.<br><br>The first Player to signal shows up as green on both his device and to the Host; the rest of the Players are then locked from answering until the Host clears, awards points, and allows more buzzing.<br><br>You can keep track of scores, and customize the value of right or wrong answers. You can group players into teams, and track scores by both player and by team. You can add optional Bonus Points if your game calls for it. You can even add a Game Timer to know when your game is done! Short on people? One person can serve as both the Player *and* the Host, awarding points while still being able to buzz in!<br><br>EZBuzzer could be used for Pub Trivia, Quiz Bowl / College Bowl, games such as Jeopardy or Family Feud, or classroom activities!   Replace messy wired buzzer systems with ease...or add an impartial judge to your game instead of guessing who was first!<br><br>EZBuzzer works over Bluetooth - no hassle with joining a WiFi network or dropped WiFi signals.  Initial start-up is simple: One person should sign on as a Host or PlayerHost, and then all others as Players.  Players will automatically connect to the Host, and then the fun can begin! As this game is Bluetooth-based, players should be nearby...this is an app to play with your friends or family together! Don&#39;t like ads? You can remove them easily for a small one-time fee.<br><br>EZBuzzer is also available on other platforms, and all versions are compatible and can be used together.<br><br>Enjoy!

    "descriptionHtml": "Looking for a Jeopardy Buzzer, Family Feud Buzzer, Quiz Bowl Buzzer, Trivia Buzzer, or playing any kind of game where a buzzer is needed to decide who rang in first? This app is a wireless, easy, and free solution, and no WiFi is required! One person plays as a Host, and then up to 15 other devices can join via Bluetooth as Players. This app does NOT contain any questions, but it DOES allow you to add a way to &quot;Buzz In&quot;, award points, and/or keep time to any game which calls for it.<br><br>The first Player to signal shows up as green on both his device and to the Host; the rest of the Players are then locked from answering until the Host clears, awards points, and allows more buzzing. Players can see the order in which they buzzed in, even if they weren&#39;t first.<br><br>You can keep track of scores, and customize the value of right or wrong answers. You can group players into teams, and track scores by both player and by team. You can add optional Bonus Points if your game calls for it. You can even add a Game Timer to know when your game is done! Short on people? One person can serve as both the Player *and* the Host, awarding points while still being able to buzz in!<br><br>EZBuzzer could be used for Pub Trivia, Quiz Bowl / College Bowl, games such as Jeopardy or Family Feud, or classroom activities!   Replace messy wired buzzer systems with ease...or add an impartial judge to your game instead of guessing who was first!<br><br>EZBuzzer works over Bluetooth - no hassle with joining a WiFi network or dropped WiFi signals.  Initial start-up is simple: One person should sign on as a Host or PlayerHost, and then all others as Players.  Players will automatically connect to the Host, and then the fun can begin! As this game is Bluetooth-based, players should be nearby...this is an app to play with your friends or family together! Don&#39;t like ads? You can remove them easily for a small one-time fee. Are you a teacher, or a generous friend? Go Premium and remove ads not just for yourself, but also for any Player while they are connected to your game as a Host.<br><br>EZBuzzer is also available on other platforms, and all versions are compatible and can be used together.<br><br>Enjoy!

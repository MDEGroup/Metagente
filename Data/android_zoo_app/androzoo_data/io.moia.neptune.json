Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone. <br> <br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park <br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone. <br> <br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park <br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else.<br><br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Google Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone.<br><br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park<br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive.

This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility!

This is in response to the increasing numbers of infections and the decisions by the federal and state governments to further restrict public life.

Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else.<br><br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Google Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port.

Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price.

Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port.

    "descriptionHtml": "Our service is temporarily suspended!<br>Since Dec 24, our service has been suspended in Hamburg and Hanover. This is in response to the increasing numbers of infections and the decisions by the federal and state governments to further restrict public life. We will keep you updated, when speed will pick up again.<br><br><br>We currently have extensive safety measures in place - on board and in our depots - so that you always travel safely in our MOIAs.<br><br>\u2022 Masks required for passengers aged 7 and up<br>\u2022 Free disinfecting wipes in every MOIA<br>\u2022 All vehicles cleaned regularly<br>\u2022 Partition between passenger cabin and driver space<br>\u2022 Maximum of five passengers allowed<br>\u2022 Masks required for depot workers<br>\u2022 All staff receive extensive infection-prevention training<br>\u2022 Adapted safety precautions at depots (e.g., with distance markings)<br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else.<br><br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Google Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone.<br><br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park<br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and be one of the first to know when we launch in other cities.<br><br><br>Do you have a question or want to give us feedback?

This is in response to the increasing numbers of infections and the decisions by the federal and state governments to further restrict public life. We will keep you updated, when speed will pick up again.<br><br><br>We currently have extensive safety measures in place - on board and in our depots - so that you always travel safely in our MOIAs.<br><br>\u2022 Masks required for passengers aged 7 and up<br>\u2022 Free disinfecting wipes in every MOIA<br>\u2022 All vehicles cleaned regularly<br>\u2022 Partition between passenger cabin and driver space<br>\u2022 Maximum of five passengers allowed<br>\u2022 Masks required for depot workers<br>\u2022 All staff receive extensive infection-prevention training<br>\u2022 Adapted safety precautions at depots (e.g., with distance markings)<br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive.

This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility!

We look forward to welcoming you back on board!<br><br>Our regular service is temporarily suspended!<br>Since Dec 24, our service has been suspended in Hamburg and Hanover. This is in response to the increasing numbers of infections and the decisions by the federal and state governments to further restrict public life. We will keep you updated, when speed will pick up again.<br><br><br>We currently have extensive safety measures in place - on board and in our depots - so that you always travel safely in our MOIAs.<br>\u2022 Passengers aged 7 and above wear an FFP2 mask on board.<br>\u2022 We are also reducing the number of passengers to a maximum of 3 per MOIA.<br>\u2022 The passenger area in every MOIA is separated from the driver\u2019s area by a protective film.<br>\u2022 The vehicles are cleaned regularly during service hours.<br>\u2022 Free disinfection wipes are waiting for you at pickup.<br>\u2022 Our drivers are regularly tested.<br><br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else.<br><br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Google Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone.<br><br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park<br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "As of now, our MOIAs are shuttling through Hamburg again during regular service hours. We\u2019re already overjoyed to welcome you back on board and to set off with you to new destinations, experiences and brand new, shared memories.<br><br>We also have great news: In Hanover, we\u2019ll be there for you again from 1 July.<br><br>Since the general conditions for our service can always change due to the current situation, we\u2019ll initially be operating with 190 MOIA shuttles in Hamburg and in an adapted service area. In Hanover, we\u2019ll be there for you from July with 40 MOIA shuttles in the entire city area. We\u2019ll regularly review how we can gradually increase our service again and will do so according to demand and current developments.<br><br>To ensure that you always travel safely in our MOIA shuttles, there are currently extensive safety measures in place on board and at our depots:<br>\u2022 Passengers aged 7 and above wear an FFP2 mask on board.<br>\u2022 We are also reducing the number of passengers to a maximum of 3 per MOIA.<br>\u2022 The passenger area in every MOIA is separated from the driver\u2019s area by a a hygienic protection screen.<br>\u2022 The vehicles are cleaned regularly during service hours.<br>\u2022 Free disinfection wipes are waiting for you at pickup.<br>\u2022 Our drivers are regularly tested.<br><br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive.

We\u2019re already overjoyed to welcome you back on board and to set off with you to new destinations, experiences and brand new, shared memories.<br><br>We also have great news: In Hanover, we\u2019ll be there for you again from 1 July.<br><br>Since the general conditions for our service can always change due to the current situation, we\u2019ll initially be operating with 190 MOIA shuttles in Hamburg and in an adapted service area. In Hanover, we\u2019ll be there for you from July with 40 MOIA shuttles in the entire city area. We\u2019ll regularly review how we can gradually increase our service again and will do so according to demand and current developments.<br><br>To ensure that you always travel safely in our MOIA shuttles, there are currently extensive safety measures in place on board and at our depots:<br>\u2022 Passengers aged 7 and above wear an FFP2 mask on board.<br>\u2022 We are also reducing the number of passengers to a maximum of 3 per MOIA.<br>\u2022 The passenger area in every MOIA is separated from the driver\u2019s area by a a hygienic protection screen.<br>\u2022 The vehicles are cleaned regularly during service hours.<br>\u2022 Free disinfection wipes are waiting for you at pickup.<br>\u2022 Our drivers are regularly tested.<br><br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else.<br><br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Google Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone.<br><br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park<br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "The time has finally come: As of now, we\u2019re operating in Hamburg and Hanover again during regular service hours. We look forward to welcoming you back on board!<br><br>To get our service back up and running again as sustainably as possible, we are initially on the road for you with 190 MOIA shuttles in Hamburg and in an adapted service area. In Hanover, we are initially operating with 40 MOIA shuttles in the entire city area. We\u2019ll regularly review how we can gradually increase our service again and will do so according to demand and current developments.<br><br>To ensure that you always travel safely in our MOIA shuttles, there are currently extensive safety measures in place on board and at our depots:<br>\u2022 Passengers aged 7 and above wear an FFP2 or surgical mask mask on board.<br>\u2022 We are also reducing the number of passengers to a maximum of 3 per MOIA.<br>\u2022 The passenger area in every MOIA is separated from the driver\u2019s area by a a hygienic protection screen.<br>\u2022 The vehicles are cleaned regularly during service hours.<br>\u2022 Free disinfection wipes are waiting for you at pickup.<br>\u2022 Our drivers are regularly tested.<br><br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else.<br><br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Google Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port.

    "descriptionHtml": "The time has finally come: As of now, we\u2019re operating in Hamburg and Hanover again during regular service hours. We look forward to welcoming you back on board!<br><br>To get our service back up and running again as sustainably as possible, we are initially on the road for you with 190 MOIA shuttles in Hamburg and in an adapted service area. In Hanover, we are initially operating with 40 MOIA shuttles in the entire city area. We\u2019ll regularly review how we can gradually increase our service again and will do so according to demand and current developments.<br><br>To ensure that you always travel safely in our MOIA shuttles, there are currently extensive safety measures in place on board and at our depots:<br>\u2022 Passengers aged 7 and above wear an FFP2 or surgical mask mask on board.<br>\u2022 We are also reducing the number of passengers to a maximum of 3 per MOIA.<br>\u2022 The passenger area in every MOIA is separated from the driver\u2019s area by a a hygienic protection screen.<br>\u2022 The vehicles are cleaned regularly during service hours.<br>\u2022 Free disinfection wipes are waiting for you at pickup.<br>\u2022 Our drivers are regularly tested.<br><br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else.<br><br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Google Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone.<br><br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park<br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "New: MOIA Express \u2013 the quick alternative. With the new option, you get to your destination more directly and have shorter walking distances for pick-up and arrival.<br><br>To ensure that you always travel safely in our MOIA shuttles, there are currently extensive safety measures in place on board and at our depots:<br>\u2022 Passengers aged 7 and above wear an FFP2 or surgical mask mask on board.<br>\u2022 The passenger area in every MOIA is separated from the driver\u2019s area by a a hygienic protection screen.<br>\u2022 The vehicles are cleaned regularly during service hours.<br>\u2022 Free disinfection wipes are waiting for you at pickup.<br><br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else.<br><br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Google Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone.<br><br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park<br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and be one of the first to know when we launch in other cities.<br><br><br>Do you have a question or want to give us feedback?

More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price.

    "descriptionHtml": "New: MOIA Express \u2013 the quick alternative. With the new option, you get to your destination more directly and have shorter walking distances for pick-up and arrival.<br><br>To ensure that you always travel safely in our MOIA shuttles, there are currently extensive safety measures in place on board and at our depots:<br>\u2022 Passengers aged 7 and above wear an FFP2 or surgical mask mask on board.<br>\u2022 The passenger area in every MOIA is separated from the driver\u2019s area by a a hygienic protection screen.<br>\u2022 The vehicles are cleaned regularly during service hours.<br>\u2022 Free disinfection wipes are waiting for you at pickup.<br><br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else.<br><br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Google Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone.<br><br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park<br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and be one of the first to know when we launch in other cities.<br><br><br>Do you have a question or want to give us feedback?

    "descriptionHtml": "New: MOIA Express \u2013 the quick alternative. With the new option, you get to your destination more directly and have shorter walking distances for pick-up and arrival.<br><br>To ensure that you always travel safely in our MOIA shuttles, there are currently extensive safety measures in place on board and at our depots:<br>\u2022 Passengers aged 7 and above wear an FFP2 or surgical mask mask on board.<br>\u2022 The passenger area in every MOIA is separated from the driver\u2019s area by a a hygienic protection screen.<br>\u2022 The vehicles are cleaned regularly during service hours.<br>\u2022 Free disinfection wipes are waiting for you at pickup.<br><br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else.<br><br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Google Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone.<br><br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park<br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and be one of the first to know when we launch in other cities.<br><br><br>Do you have a question or want to give us feedback?

    "descriptionHtml": "New: MOIA Express \u2013 the quick alternative. With the new option, you get to your destination more directly and have shorter walking distances for pick-up and arrival.<br><br>To ensure that you always travel safely in our MOIA shuttles, there are currently extensive safety measures in place on board and at our depots:<br>\u2022 Passengers aged 7 and above wear an FFP2 or surgical mask mask on board.<br>\u2022 The passenger area in every MOIA is separated from the driver\u2019s area by a a hygienic protection screen.<br>\u2022 The vehicles are cleaned regularly during service hours.<br>\u2022 Free disinfection wipes are waiting for you at pickup.<br><br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else.<br><br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Google Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone.<br><br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park<br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and be one of the first to know when we launch in other cities.<br><br><br>Do you have a question or want to give us feedback?

More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price.

With the new option, you get to your destination more directly and have shorter walking distances for pick-up and arrival.<br><br>To ensure that you always travel safely in our MOIA shuttles, there are currently extensive safety measures in place on board and at our depots:<br>\u2022 Passengers aged 7 and above wear an FFP2 or surgical mask mask on board.<br>\u2022 The passenger area in every MOIA is separated from the driver\u2019s area by a a hygienic protection screen.<br>\u2022 The vehicles are cleaned regularly during service hours.<br>\u2022 Free disinfection wipes are waiting for you at pickup.<br><br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else.<br><br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Google Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone.<br><br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park<br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

With the new option, you get to your destination more directly and have shorter walking distances for pick-up and arrival.<br><br>To ensure that you always travel safely in our MOIA shuttles, there are currently extensive safety measures in place on board and at our depots:<br>\u2022 Passengers aged 7 and above wear an FFP2 or surgical mask mask on board.<br>\u2022 The passenger area in every MOIA is separated from the driver\u2019s area by a a hygienic protection screen.<br>\u2022 The vehicles are cleaned regularly during service hours.<br>\u2022 Free disinfection wipes are waiting for you at pickup.<br><br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive.

This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone.<br><br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park<br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "New: MOIA Express \u2013 the quick alternative. With the new option, you get to your destination more directly and have shorter walking distances for pick-up and arrival.<br><br>To ensure that you always travel safely in our MOIA shuttles, there are currently extensive safety measures in place on board and at our depots:<br>\u2022 Passengers aged 7 and above wear an FFP2 or surgical mask mask on board.<br>\u2022 The passenger area in every MOIA is separated from the driver\u2019s area by a a hygienic protection screen.<br>\u2022 The vehicles are cleaned regularly during service hours.<br>\u2022 Free disinfection wipes are waiting for you at pickup.<br><br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else.<br><br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Google Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port.

    "descriptionHtml": "New: MOIA Express \u2013 the quick alternative. With the new option, you get to your destination more directly and have shorter walking distances for pick-up and arrival.<br><br>To ensure that you always travel safely in our MOIA shuttles, there are currently extensive safety measures in place on board and at our depots:<br>\u2022 Passengers aged 7 and above wear an FFP2 or surgical mask mask on board.<br>\u2022 The passenger area in every MOIA is separated from the driver\u2019s area by a a hygienic protection screen.<br>\u2022 The vehicles are cleaned regularly during service hours.<br>\u2022 Free disinfection wipes are waiting for you at pickup.<br><br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else.<br><br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Google Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone.<br><br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park<br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "New: MOIA Express \u2013 the quick alternative. With the new option, you get to your destination more directly and have shorter walking distances for pick-up and arrival.<br><br>To ensure that you always travel safely in our MOIA shuttles, there are currently extensive safety measures in place on board and at our depots:<br>\u2022 Passengers aged 7 and above wear an FFP2 or surgical mask mask on board.<br>\u2022 The passenger area in every MOIA is separated from the driver\u2019s area by a a hygienic protection screen.<br>\u2022 The vehicles are cleaned regularly during service hours.<br>\u2022 Free disinfection wipes are waiting for you at pickup.<br><br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else.<br><br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Google Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone.<br><br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park<br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "New: MOIA Express \u2013 the quick alternative. With the new option, you get to your destination more directly and have shorter walking distances for pick-up and arrival.<br><br>To ensure that you always travel safely in our MOIA shuttles, there are currently extensive safety measures in place on board and at our depots:<br>\u2022 Passengers aged 7 and above wear an FFP2 or surgical mask mask on board.<br>\u2022 The passenger area in every MOIA is separated from the driver\u2019s area by a a hygienic protection screen.<br>\u2022 The vehicles are cleaned regularly during service hours.<br>\u2022 Free disinfection wipes are waiting for you at pickup.<br><br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Google Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else.<br><br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Google Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six (currently: five) people heading in the same direction travel together. This is analternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone.<br><br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park<br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and be one of the first to know when we launch in other cities.<br><br><br>Do you have a question or want to give us feedback?

Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price.

    "descriptionHtml": "Please note: Passengers aged 7 and above wear a medical mask (surgical mask) on board. <br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone. <br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park <br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to four other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility!

    "descriptionHtml": "Please note: Passengers aged 7 and above wear a medical mask (surgical mask) on board. <br><br>MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility!

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion.

Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone. <br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park <br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together.

So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone. <br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park <br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone. <br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park <br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion.

Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together.

Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay.

More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together.

So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone. <br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park <br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone. <br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park <br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone. <br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park <br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility!

Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city.

Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone. <br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park <br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone. <br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park <br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone. <br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park <br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone. <br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park <br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together.

So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone. <br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park <br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "MOIA brings you comfortably to your destination in Hamburg or Hanover: to the central station, train or most important places to see in the city. Leave your car elsewhere, book your ride with our convenient app, and pay by credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you travel by bicycle or scooter already, you\u2019ll find the perfect zero-emission alternative with the fully electric MOIA shuttle. More convenient than public transport, no hunting for a car park, and no unnecessary detours, enjoy comfortable and private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices. Unlike a cab, you share your ride with up to five other passengers \u2013 which lets you travel at an exceptionally low price. The app of course tells you in advance how much it costs, where you\u2019ll be picked up, and when you\u2019re expected to arrive. You\u2019ll save yourself stress and reduce traffic for everyone else. <br> <br>How it works:<br><br>\u2022 Download the MOIA app and sign up.<br>\u2022 Enter your starting point and destination.<br>\u2022 Add a credit card or PayPal or Apple Pay account.<br>\u2022 Request and book a ride.<br>\u2022 Get picked up at a stop near you.<br>\u2022 Share the journey, help reduce traffic, and save money.<br><br><br>What\u2019s so great about it?<br><br>Easy: Up to six people heading in the same direction travel together. This is an alternative to train, bus, metro, car sharing, taxi, and rental car, helping reduce congestion. So, lean back and enjoy the nice feeling of doing a little something for the environment with every ride through the city. Every trip you take helps make Hamburg and Hanover a bit more livable, whether on your way to work, the airport, the train station, the zoo, or Hamburg\u2019s port. This is how transport is turned into mobility! And how the future of sharing becomes relevant for everyone. <br><br>One MOIA, with benefits for all:<br><br>\u2022 Arrive relaxed, in comfort, and safely<br>\u2022 Private seats, Wi-Fi, and USB ports for charging your devices<br>\u2022 Quiet and fully electric journeys across town<br>\u2022 No stress, no transfers, and no looking for a car park <br>\u2022 Zero emissions and zero CO2 for your city<br>\u2022 Easy and app-based, available from (almost) anywhere<br>\u2022 You\u2019re told your fare and ETA before booking<br>\u2022 Stops near you, short wait, and no transfers<br><br>You can ride with MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover currently.

    "descriptionHtml": "Not a subscriber yet? Please go to https://ondemand.animalflow.com to become a member and start working out today.  <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand brings you everything you need to learn this challenging and fun bodyweight workout anywhere you want.  Work out at home, in the park, at the gym - with no equipment necessary, all you need is your body and some space!  <br><br>Animal Flow is a ground-based fitness program that combines inspirations from gymnastics, hand balancing, yoga-style movements, and breakdancing, along with animal locomotion forms.  The program is extremely versatile, and individuals of all fitness levels can tailor the components to their own skill level and goals.  <br><br>Use the program\u2019s multiple components to improve strength power, flexibility, mobility, and coordination.  You can use Animal Flow as a stand-alone workout or integrate it with your existing training plans.  <br><br>WHAT\u2019S INCLUDED? <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand includes three sections to help you get the most out of the program: <br><br>Section 1:  The Tutorials section includes individual videos where Animal Flow creator Mike Fitch provides detailed instructions on how to correctly perform each of the program\u2019s movements.  You\u2019ll find all of the movements from both Level 1 and Level 2 of the program here.  <br><br>Section 2:   The Classes section includes group classes that you can follow along.  You\u2019ll find different styles, lengths, and intensities of classes, including some focused on mobility, some focused on building your flow skills, and some focused on just providing you with a really killer high intensity workout.  <br><br>Section 3:  The Flows section is where we say the real magic happens. This is where you link together the many different individual movements into seamless flows.  Our pre-designed flows range from easy to difficult and are just a few minutes long.  <br><br>We\u2019ll release a new Flow every Monday morning, so you\u2019ll always have something new to try. <br><br>WHO SHOULD TRY IT? <br><br>Animal Flow is designed to provide benefits for individuals of all ages and skill levels.  Some of the flows and classes are targeted to the beginner-level, utilizing only low-impact, easier-to-learn movements. Other more advanced flows and classes incorporate much more dynamic power and stability challenges. You choose what works best for your current abilities and progress at your own pace. <br><br><br>If you\u2019re already great with mobility and flexibility, Animal Flow can help you build strength and power.  If you\u2019re already strong, Animal Flow can help you improve your mobility and flexibility. Whether you are an athlete, or someone just starting to work out, or somewhere in between, you\u2019ll benefit from incorporating some Animal Flow into your fitness routines.  <br><br>LIMITATIONS <br><br>Animal Flow is a bodyweight fitness program which requires spending a lot of time with your hands and feet on the ground.  If you have any medical or physical conditions which limit your ability to support your bodyweight in this position, you should consult with your physician.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Not a subscriber yet? Please go to https://ondemand.animalflow.com to become a member and start working out today.  <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand brings you everything you need to learn this challenging and fun bodyweight workout anywhere you want.  Work out at home, in the park, at the gym - with no equipment necessary, all you need is your body and some space!  <br><br>Animal Flow is a ground-based fitness program that combines inspirations from gymnastics, hand balancing, yoga-style movements, and breakdancing, along with animal locomotion forms.  The program is extremely versatile, and individuals of all fitness levels can tailor the components to their own skill level and goals.  <br><br>Use the program\u2019s multiple components to improve strength power, flexibility, mobility, and coordination.  You can use Animal Flow as a stand-alone workout or integrate it with your existing training plans.  <br><br>WHAT\u2019S INCLUDED? <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand includes three sections to help you get the most out of the program: <br><br>Section 1:  The Tutorials section includes individual videos where Animal Flow creator Mike Fitch provides detailed instructions on how to correctly perform each of the program\u2019s movements.  You\u2019ll find all of the movements from both Level 1 and Level 2 of the program here.  <br><br>Section 2:   The Classes section includes group classes that you can follow along.  You\u2019ll find different styles, lengths, and intensities of classes, including some focused on mobility, some focused on building your flow skills, and some focused on just providing you with a really killer high intensity workout.  <br><br>Section 3:  The Flows section is where we say the real magic happens. This is where you link together the many different individual movements into seamless flows.  Our pre-designed flows range from easy to difficult and are just a few minutes long.  <br><br>We\u2019ll release a new Flow every Monday morning, so you\u2019ll always have something new to try. <br><br>WHO SHOULD TRY IT? <br><br>Animal Flow is designed to provide benefits for individuals of all ages and skill levels.  Some of the flows and classes are targeted to the beginner-level, utilizing only low-impact, easier-to-learn movements. Other more advanced flows and classes incorporate much more dynamic power and stability challenges. You choose what works best for your current abilities and progress at your own pace. <br><br><br>If you\u2019re already great with mobility and flexibility, Animal Flow can help you build strength and power.  If you\u2019re already strong, Animal Flow can help you improve your mobility and flexibility. Whether you are an athlete, or someone just starting to work out, or somewhere in between, you\u2019ll benefit from incorporating some Animal Flow into your fitness routines.  <br><br>LIMITATIONS <br><br>Animal Flow is a bodyweight fitness program which requires spending a lot of time with your hands and feet on the ground.  If you have any medical or physical conditions which limit your ability to support your bodyweight in this position, you should consult with your physician.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Not a subscriber yet? Please go to https://ondemand.animalflow.com to become a member and start working out today.  <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand brings you everything you need to learn this challenging and fun bodyweight workout anywhere you want.  Work out at home, in the park, at the gym - with no equipment necessary, all you need is your body and some space!  <br><br>Animal Flow is a ground-based fitness program that combines inspirations from gymnastics, hand balancing, yoga-style movements, and breakdancing, along with animal locomotion forms.  The program is extremely versatile, and individuals of all fitness levels can tailor the components to their own skill level and goals.  <br><br>Use the program\u2019s multiple components to improve strength power, flexibility, mobility, and coordination.  You can use Animal Flow as a stand-alone workout or integrate it with your existing training plans.  <br><br>WHAT\u2019S INCLUDED? <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand includes three sections to help you get the most out of the program: <br><br>Section 1:  The Tutorials section includes individual videos where Animal Flow creator Mike Fitch provides detailed instructions on how to correctly perform each of the program\u2019s movements.  You\u2019ll find all of the movements from both Level 1 and Level 2 of the program here.  <br><br>Section 2:   The Classes section includes group classes that you can follow along.  You\u2019ll find different styles, lengths, and intensities of classes, including some focused on mobility, some focused on building your flow skills, and some focused on just providing you with a really killer high intensity workout.  <br><br>Section 3:  The Flows section is where we say the real magic happens. This is where you link together the many different individual movements into seamless flows.  Our pre-designed flows range from easy to difficult and are just a few minutes long.  <br><br>We\u2019ll release a new Flow every Monday morning, so you\u2019ll always have something new to try. <br><br>WHO SHOULD TRY IT? <br><br>Animal Flow is designed to provide benefits for individuals of all ages and skill levels.  Some of the flows and classes are targeted to the beginner-level, utilizing only low-impact, easier-to-learn movements. Other more advanced flows and classes incorporate much more dynamic power and stability challenges. You choose what works best for your current abilities and progress at your own pace. <br><br><br>If you\u2019re already great with mobility and flexibility, Animal Flow can help you build strength and power.  If you\u2019re already strong, Animal Flow can help you improve your mobility and flexibility. Whether you are an athlete, or someone just starting to work out, or somewhere in between, you\u2019ll benefit from incorporating some Animal Flow into your fitness routines.  <br><br>LIMITATIONS <br><br>Animal Flow is a bodyweight fitness program which requires spending a lot of time with your hands and feet on the ground.  If you have any medical or physical conditions which limit your ability to support your bodyweight in this position, you should consult with your physician.",

Please go to https://ondemand.animalflow.com to become a member and start working out today.  <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand brings you everything you need to learn this challenging and fun bodyweight workout anywhere you want.  Work out at home, in the park, at the gym - with no equipment necessary, all you need is your body and some space!  <br><br>Animal Flow is a ground-based fitness program that combines inspirations from gymnastics, hand balancing, yoga-style movements, and breakdancing, along with animal locomotion forms.  The program is extremely versatile, and individuals of all fitness levels can tailor the components to their own skill level and goals.  <br><br>Use the program\u2019s multiple components to improve strength power, flexibility, mobility, and coordination.  You can use Animal Flow as a stand-alone workout or integrate it with your existing training plans.  <br><br>WHAT\u2019S INCLUDED? <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand includes three sections to help you get the most out of the program: <br><br>Section 1:  The Tutorials section includes individual videos where Animal Flow creator Mike Fitch provides detailed instructions on how to correctly perform each of the program\u2019s movements.  You\u2019ll find all of the movements from both Level 1 and Level 2 of the program here.  <br><br>Section 2:   The Classes section includes group classes that you can follow along.  You\u2019ll find different styles, lengths, and intensities of classes, including some focused on mobility, some focused on building your flow skills, and some focused on just providing you with a really killer high intensity workout.  <br><br>Section 3:  The Flows section is where we say the real magic happens. This is where you link together the many different individual movements into seamless flows.  Our pre-designed flows range from easy to difficult and are just a few minutes long.  <br><br>We\u2019ll release a new Flow every Monday morning, so you\u2019ll always have something new to try. <br><br>WHO SHOULD TRY IT? <br><br>Animal Flow is designed to provide benefits for individuals of all ages and skill levels.  Some of the flows and classes are targeted to the beginner-level, utilizing only low-impact, easier-to-learn movements. Other more advanced flows and classes incorporate much more dynamic power and stability challenges. You choose what works best for your current abilities and progress at your own pace. <br><br><br>If you\u2019re already great with mobility and flexibility, Animal Flow can help you build strength and power.  If you\u2019re already strong, Animal Flow can help you improve your mobility and flexibility. Whether you are an athlete, or someone just starting to work out, or somewhere in between, you\u2019ll benefit from incorporating some Animal Flow into your fitness routines.  <br><br>LIMITATIONS <br><br>Animal Flow is a bodyweight fitness program which requires spending a lot of time with your hands and feet on the ground.  If you have any medical or physical conditions which limit your ability to support your bodyweight in this position, you should consult with your physician.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Not a subscriber yet? Please go to https://ondemand.animalflow.com to become a member and start working out today.  <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand brings you everything you need to learn this challenging and fun bodyweight workout anywhere you want.  Work out at home, in the park, at the gym - with no equipment necessary, all you need is your body and some space!  <br><br>Animal Flow is a ground-based fitness program that combines inspirations from gymnastics, hand balancing, yoga-style movements, and breakdancing, along with animal locomotion forms.  The program is extremely versatile, and individuals of all fitness levels can tailor the components to their own skill level and goals.  <br><br>Use the program\u2019s multiple components to improve strength power, flexibility, mobility, and coordination.  You can use Animal Flow as a stand-alone workout or integrate it with your existing training plans.  <br><br>WHAT\u2019S INCLUDED? <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand includes three sections to help you get the most out of the program: <br><br>Section 1:  The Tutorials section includes individual videos where Animal Flow creator Mike Fitch provides detailed instructions on how to correctly perform each of the program\u2019s movements.  You\u2019ll find all of the movements from both Level 1 and Level 2 of the program here.  <br><br>Section 2:   The Classes section includes group classes that you can follow along.  You\u2019ll find different styles, lengths, and intensities of classes, including some focused on mobility, some focused on building your flow skills, and some focused on just providing you with a really killer high intensity workout.  <br><br>Section 3:  The Flows section is where we say the real magic happens. This is where you link together the many different individual movements into seamless flows.  Our pre-designed flows range from easy to difficult and are just a few minutes long.  <br><br>We\u2019ll release a new Flow every Monday morning, so you\u2019ll always have something new to try. <br><br>WHO SHOULD TRY IT? <br><br>Animal Flow is designed to provide benefits for individuals of all ages and skill levels.  Some of the flows and classes are targeted to the beginner-level, utilizing only low-impact, easier-to-learn movements. Other more advanced flows and classes incorporate much more dynamic power and stability challenges. You choose what works best for your current abilities and progress at your own pace. <br><br><br>If you\u2019re already great with mobility and flexibility, Animal Flow can help you build strength and power.  If you\u2019re already strong, Animal Flow can help you improve your mobility and flexibility. Whether you are an athlete, or someone just starting to work out, or somewhere in between, you\u2019ll benefit from incorporating some Animal Flow into your fitness routines.  <br><br>LIMITATIONS <br><br>Animal Flow is a bodyweight fitness program which requires spending a lot of time with your hands and feet on the ground.  If you have any medical or physical conditions which limit your ability to support your bodyweight in this position, you should consult with your physician.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Not a subscriber yet? Please go to https://ondemand.animalflow.com to become a member and start working out today.  <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand brings you everything you need to learn this challenging and fun bodyweight workout anywhere you want.  Work out at home, in the park, at the gym - with no equipment necessary, all you need is your body and some space!  <br><br>Animal Flow is a ground-based fitness program that combines inspirations from gymnastics, hand balancing, yoga-style movements, and breakdancing, along with animal locomotion forms.  The program is extremely versatile, and individuals of all fitness levels can tailor the components to their own skill level and goals.  <br><br>Use the program\u2019s multiple components to improve strength power, flexibility, mobility, and coordination.  You can use Animal Flow as a stand-alone workout or integrate it with your existing training plans.  <br><br>WHAT\u2019S INCLUDED? <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand includes three sections to help you get the most out of the program: <br><br>Section 1:  The Tutorials section includes individual videos where Animal Flow creator Mike Fitch provides detailed instructions on how to correctly perform each of the program\u2019s movements.  You\u2019ll find all of the movements from both Level 1 and Level 2 of the program here.  <br><br>Section 2:   The Classes section includes group classes that you can follow along.  You\u2019ll find different styles, lengths, and intensities of classes, including some focused on mobility, some focused on building your flow skills, and some focused on just providing you with a really killer high intensity workout.  <br><br>Section 3:  The Flows section is where we say the real magic happens. This is where you link together the many different individual movements into seamless flows.  Our pre-designed flows range from easy to difficult and are just a few minutes long.  <br><br>We\u2019ll release a new Flow every Monday morning, so you\u2019ll always have something new to try. <br><br>WHO SHOULD TRY IT? <br><br>Animal Flow is designed to provide benefits for individuals of all ages and skill levels.  Some of the flows and classes are targeted to the beginner-level, utilizing only low-impact, easier-to-learn movements. Other more advanced flows and classes incorporate much more dynamic power and stability challenges. You choose what works best for your current abilities and progress at your own pace. <br><br><br>If you\u2019re already great with mobility and flexibility, Animal Flow can help you build strength and power.  If you\u2019re already strong, Animal Flow can help you improve your mobility and flexibility. Whether you are an athlete, or someone just starting to work out, or somewhere in between, you\u2019ll benefit from incorporating some Animal Flow into your fitness routines.  <br><br>LIMITATIONS <br><br>Animal Flow is a bodyweight fitness program which requires spending a lot of time with your hands and feet on the ground.  If you have any medical or physical conditions which limit your ability to support your bodyweight in this position, you should consult with your physician.",

Please go to https://ondemand.animalflow.com to become a member and start working out today.  <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand brings you everything you need to learn this challenging and fun bodyweight workout anywhere you want.  Work out at home, in the park, at the gym - with no equipment necessary, all you need is your body and some space!  <br><br>Animal Flow is a ground-based fitness program that combines inspirations from gymnastics, hand balancing, yoga-style movements, and breakdancing, along with animal locomotion forms.  The program is extremely versatile, and individuals of all fitness levels can tailor the components to their own skill level and goals.  <br><br>Use the program\u2019s multiple components to improve strength power, flexibility, mobility, and coordination.  You can use Animal Flow as a stand-alone workout or integrate it with your existing training plans.  <br><br>WHAT\u2019S INCLUDED? <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand includes three sections to help you get the most out of the program: <br><br>Section 1:  The Tutorials section includes individual videos where Animal Flow creator Mike Fitch provides detailed instructions on how to correctly perform each of the program\u2019s movements.  You\u2019ll find all of the movements from both Level 1 and Level 2 of the program here.  <br><br>Section 2:   The Classes section includes group classes that you can follow along.  You\u2019ll find different styles, lengths, and intensities of classes, including some focused on mobility, some focused on building your flow skills, and some focused on just providing you with a really killer high intensity workout.  <br><br>Section 3:  The Flows section is where we say the real magic happens. This is where you link together the many different individual movements into seamless flows.  Our pre-designed flows range from easy to difficult and are just a few minutes long.  <br><br>We\u2019ll release a new Flow every Monday morning, so you\u2019ll always have something new to try. <br><br>WHO SHOULD TRY IT? <br><br>Animal Flow is designed to provide benefits for individuals of all ages and skill levels.  Some of the flows and classes are targeted to the beginner-level, utilizing only low-impact, easier-to-learn movements. Other more advanced flows and classes incorporate much more dynamic power and stability challenges. You choose what works best for your current abilities and progress at your own pace. <br><br><br>If you\u2019re already great with mobility and flexibility, Animal Flow can help you build strength and power.  If you\u2019re already strong, Animal Flow can help you improve your mobility and flexibility. Whether you are an athlete, or someone just starting to work out, or somewhere in between, you\u2019ll benefit from incorporating some Animal Flow into your fitness routines.  <br><br>LIMITATIONS <br><br>Animal Flow is a bodyweight fitness program which requires spending a lot of time with your hands and feet on the ground.  If you have any medical or physical conditions which limit your ability to support your bodyweight in this position, you should consult with your physician.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Not a subscriber yet? Please go to https://ondemand.animalflow.com to become a member and start working out today.  <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand brings you everything you need to learn this challenging and fun bodyweight workout anywhere you want.  Work out at home, in the park, at the gym - with no equipment necessary, all you need is your body and some space!  <br><br>Animal Flow is a ground-based fitness program that combines inspirations from gymnastics, hand balancing, yoga-style movements, and breakdancing, along with animal locomotion forms.  The program is extremely versatile, and individuals of all fitness levels can tailor the components to their own skill level and goals.  <br><br>Use the program\u2019s multiple components to improve strength power, flexibility, mobility, and coordination.  You can use Animal Flow as a stand-alone workout or integrate it with your existing training plans.  <br><br>WHAT\u2019S INCLUDED? <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand includes three sections to help you get the most out of the program: <br><br>Section 1:  The Tutorials section includes individual videos where Animal Flow creator Mike Fitch provides detailed instructions on how to correctly perform each of the program\u2019s movements.  You\u2019ll find all of the movements from both Level 1 and Level 2 of the program here.  <br><br>Section 2:   The Classes section includes group classes that you can follow along.  You\u2019ll find different styles, lengths, and intensities of classes, including some focused on mobility, some focused on building your flow skills, and some focused on just providing you with a really killer high intensity workout.  <br><br>Section 3:  The Flows section is where we say the real magic happens. This is where you link together the many different individual movements into seamless flows.  Our pre-designed flows range from easy to difficult and are just a few minutes long.  <br><br>We\u2019ll release a new Flow every Monday morning, so you\u2019ll always have something new to try. <br><br>WHO SHOULD TRY IT? <br><br>Animal Flow is designed to provide benefits for individuals of all ages and skill levels.  Some of the flows and classes are targeted to the beginner-level, utilizing only low-impact, easier-to-learn movements. Other more advanced flows and classes incorporate much more dynamic power and stability challenges. You choose what works best for your current abilities and progress at your own pace. <br><br><br>If you\u2019re already great with mobility and flexibility, Animal Flow can help you build strength and power.  If you\u2019re already strong, Animal Flow can help you improve your mobility and flexibility. Whether you are an athlete, or someone just starting to work out, or somewhere in between, you\u2019ll benefit from incorporating some Animal Flow into your fitness routines.  <br><br>LIMITATIONS <br><br>Animal Flow is a bodyweight fitness program which requires spending a lot of time with your hands and feet on the ground.  If you have any medical or physical conditions which limit your ability to support your bodyweight in this position, you should consult with your physician.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Not a subscriber yet? Please go to https://ondemand.animalflow.com to become a member and start working out today.  <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand brings you everything you need to learn this challenging and fun bodyweight workout anywhere you want.  Work out at home, in the park, at the gym - with no equipment necessary, all you need is your body and some space!  <br><br>Animal Flow is a ground-based fitness program that combines inspirations from gymnastics, hand balancing, yoga-style movements, and breakdancing, along with animal locomotion forms.  The program is extremely versatile, and individuals of all fitness levels can tailor the components to their own skill level and goals.  <br><br>Use the program\u2019s multiple components to improve strength power, flexibility, mobility, and coordination.  You can use Animal Flow as a stand-alone workout or integrate it with your existing training plans.  <br><br>WHAT\u2019S INCLUDED? <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand includes three sections to help you get the most out of the program: <br><br>Section 1:  The Tutorials section includes individual videos where Animal Flow creator Mike Fitch provides detailed instructions on how to correctly perform each of the program\u2019s movements.  You\u2019ll find all of the movements from both Level 1 and Level 2 of the program here.  <br><br>Section 2:   The Classes section includes group classes that you can follow along.  You\u2019ll find different styles, lengths, and intensities of classes, including some focused on mobility, some focused on building your flow skills, and some focused on just providing you with a really killer high intensity workout.  <br><br>Section 3:  The Flows section is where we say the real magic happens. This is where you link together the many different individual movements into seamless flows.  Our pre-designed flows range from easy to difficult and are just a few minutes long.  <br><br>We\u2019ll release a new Flow every Monday morning, so you\u2019ll always have something new to try. <br><br>WHO SHOULD TRY IT? <br><br>Animal Flow is designed to provide benefits for individuals of all ages and skill levels.  Some of the flows and classes are targeted to the beginner-level, utilizing only low-impact, easier-to-learn movements. Other more advanced flows and classes incorporate much more dynamic power and stability challenges. You choose what works best for your current abilities and progress at your own pace. <br><br><br>If you\u2019re already great with mobility and flexibility, Animal Flow can help you build strength and power.  If you\u2019re already strong, Animal Flow can help you improve your mobility and flexibility. Whether you are an athlete, or someone just starting to work out, or somewhere in between, you\u2019ll benefit from incorporating some Animal Flow into your fitness routines.  <br><br>LIMITATIONS <br><br>Animal Flow is a bodyweight fitness program which requires spending a lot of time with your hands and feet on the ground.  If you have any medical or physical conditions which limit your ability to support your bodyweight in this position, you should consult with your physician.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Not a subscriber yet? Please go to https://ondemand.animalflow.com to become a member and start working out today.  <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand brings you everything you need to learn this challenging and fun bodyweight workout anywhere you want.  Work out at home, in the park, at the gym - with no equipment necessary, all you need is your body and some space!  <br><br>Animal Flow is a ground-based fitness program that combines inspirations from gymnastics, hand balancing, yoga-style movements, and breakdancing, along with animal locomotion forms.  The program is extremely versatile, and individuals of all fitness levels can tailor the components to their own skill level and goals.  <br><br>Use the program\u2019s multiple components to improve strength power, flexibility, mobility, and coordination.  You can use Animal Flow as a stand-alone workout or integrate it with your existing training plans.  <br><br>WHAT\u2019S INCLUDED? <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand includes three sections to help you get the most out of the program: <br><br>Section 1:  The Tutorials section includes individual videos where Animal Flow creator Mike Fitch provides detailed instructions on how to correctly perform each of the program\u2019s movements.  You\u2019ll find all of the movements from both Level 1 and Level 2 of the program here.  <br><br>Section 2:   The Classes section includes group classes that you can follow along.  You\u2019ll find different styles, lengths, and intensities of classes, including some focused on mobility, some focused on building your flow skills, and some focused on just providing you with a really killer high intensity workout.  <br><br>Section 3:  The Flows section is where we say the real magic happens. This is where you link together the many different individual movements into seamless flows.  Our pre-designed flows range from easy to difficult and are just a few minutes long.  <br><br>We\u2019ll release a new Flow every Monday morning, so you\u2019ll always have something new to try. <br><br>WHO SHOULD TRY IT? <br><br>Animal Flow is designed to provide benefits for individuals of all ages and skill levels.  Some of the flows and classes are targeted to the beginner-level, utilizing only low-impact, easier-to-learn movements. Other more advanced flows and classes incorporate much more dynamic power and stability challenges. You choose what works best for your current abilities and progress at your own pace. <br><br><br>If you\u2019re already great with mobility and flexibility, Animal Flow can help you build strength and power.  If you\u2019re already strong, Animal Flow can help you improve your mobility and flexibility. Whether you are an athlete, or someone just starting to work out, or somewhere in between, you\u2019ll benefit from incorporating some Animal Flow into your fitness routines.  <br><br>LIMITATIONS <br><br>Animal Flow is a bodyweight fitness program which requires spending a lot of time with your hands and feet on the ground.  If you have any medical or physical conditions which limit your ability to support your bodyweight in this position, you should consult with your physician.",

Please go to https://ondemand.animalflow.com to become a member and start working out today.  <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand brings you everything you need to learn this challenging and fun bodyweight workout anywhere you want.  Work out at home, in the park, at the gym - with no equipment necessary, all you need is your body and some space!  <br><br>Animal Flow is a ground-based fitness program that combines inspirations from gymnastics, hand balancing, yoga-style movements, and breakdancing, along with animal locomotion forms.  The program is extremely versatile, and individuals of all fitness levels can tailor the components to their own skill level and goals.  <br><br>Use the program\u2019s multiple components to improve strength power, flexibility, mobility, and coordination.  You can use Animal Flow as a stand-alone workout or integrate it with your existing training plans.  <br><br>WHAT\u2019S INCLUDED? <br><br>Animal Flow On Demand includes three sections to help you get the most out of the program: <br><br>Section 1:  The Tutorials section includes individual videos where Animal Flow creator Mike Fitch provides detailed instructions on how to correctly perform each of the program\u2019s movements.  You\u2019ll find all of the movements from both Level 1 and Level 2 of the program here.  <br><br>Section 2:   The Classes section includes group classes that you can follow along.  You\u2019ll find different styles, lengths, and intensities of classes, including some focused on mobility, some focused on building your flow skills, and some focused on just providing you with a really killer high intensity workout.  <br><br>Section 3:  The Flows section is where we say the real magic happens. This is where you link together the many different individual movements into seamless flows.  Our pre-designed flows range from easy to difficult and are just a few minutes long.  <br><br>We\u2019ll release a new Flow every Monday morning, so you\u2019ll always have something new to try. <br><br>WHO SHOULD TRY IT? <br><br>Animal Flow is designed to provide benefits for individuals of all ages and skill levels.  Some of the flows and classes are targeted to the beginner-level, utilizing only low-impact, easier-to-learn movements. Other more advanced flows and classes incorporate much more dynamic power and stability challenges. You choose what works best for your current abilities and progress at your own pace. <br><br><br>If you\u2019re already great with mobility and flexibility, Animal Flow can help you build strength and power.  If you\u2019re already strong, Animal Flow can help you improve your mobility and flexibility. Whether you are an athlete, or someone just starting to work out, or somewhere in between, you\u2019ll benefit from incorporating some Animal Flow into your fitness routines.  <br><br>LIMITATIONS <br><br>Animal Flow is a bodyweight fitness program which requires spending a lot of time with your hands and feet on the ground.  If you have any medical or physical conditions which limit your ability to support your bodyweight in this position, you should consult with your physician.",

You&#39;ll receive a notification when a product will soon expire. Each product has a status that will be set automatically according to expiration date. This status allows, among other things, to identify at a glance which food to eat first! Every aspect of the app is customizable in the app options (number of days before the first notification for exemple).<br><br>The purpose of the application? Avoid finding outdated foods, forgotten at the back of your fridge or at the back of your cake cupboards.<br><br>In addition, the application will allow you to have available a complete inventory of what you have at home. For example, it is very practical during shopping when you no longer remember what you have and therefore what to buy. (You can also make a &quot;workshop&quot; list why not!)<br><br>As a bonus, by using the application daily, when I didn&#39;t even think about sharing it with people, I discovered a nice little trick, the meal idea.<br>Often as a student I have to think about what to eat, what to cook. With the app I quickly find ideas by looking at all the products I have, what to eat first. I also have fun doing little cooking challenges with what I have at home.<br><br>It&#39;s an easy-to-use app, intuitive.<br>I fully understand that this app is not for everyone. I know it can be overwhelming for some people to fill in their groceries on an app, on their phone. It is certain that the majority of people will prefer more traditional methods. Even knowing that, if I could even help one person, I would be very happy.<br><br>On average, I will spend 5 minutes more to store my groceries (there are two of us at home) but I will save time in the end (no more need for a shopping list, no need to open the fridge at all costs, no more worry about expiration dates\u2026) and reduce my waste and therefore my money spent.<br><br>Together, let&#39;s say Stop and Fight against Food Waste.<br><br>If you want to report a bug, ask a question, offer your help or just chat, you can be the first to join my Discord server https://discord.gg/Y3taFX59KY<br><br>Or you can email me at the following address: contact@harderue.com\t<br><br>Harderue.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Easily list and sort your products with their expiry date when they have one!<br><br>The objective of the application is to avoid the waste of forgotten food at the bottom of the fridge or at the bottom of the cupboards because of exceeded expiry dates. To do this, you will be able to add your products to lists that you have previously created. For example, you will be able to create a list called Fridge in which you will add the product Cheese or Yogurt.<br><br>When creating your product, you will be able to enter its name, the quantity of the product as well as its expiry date if the product has one. You can also choose a suitable Icon from a list of more than 1000 sorted Icons. Creating a list is similar, you will need to enter its name and choose an Icon.<br><br>The strength of the application is that all these products will automatically sort themselves according to their expiry date, to highlight products with an approaching expiry date. The products highlighted will be those to consume in priority.<br><br>There is a status system for products, determined by the number of days before their expiry date, for example, a product with an expired date will have an expired product status, a product with a very close expiry date will have an alert status. All these features can be changed in the app settings, including the number of days before expiration that will trigger the alerts. The application is intuitive and very easy to use for everyone.<br><br>In addition to this, the application will allow you to have a complete inventory of the fridge and the cupboards, which is very practical, like while shopping, when you no longer remember what is missing and therefore what you should buy. The application is also very practical for being able to help you plan your meals for the week in advance, by optimizing the use of products with a near expiry date.<br><br>Less waste, less unnecessary spending of money, better management of your products, better organization for meals, recipe challenges with foods with close expiry dates, why not give this application a chance, which as a bonus, is super cute!<br><br>Together, let&#39;s say Stop and Fight Food and Waste, for the Planet, and our Wallet!<br><br>If you want to report a bug, ask a question, offer your help or just chat, you can be the first one to join my Discord server https://discord.gg/Y3taFX59KY<br><br>Or you can send me an email at the following address: contact@harderue.com<br><br>Harderue.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Easily list and sort your products with their expiry date when they have one!<br><br>The goal of the application is to avoid the waste of forgotten food at the bottom of the fridge or at the bottom of the cupboards because of exceeded expiry dates. To do this, you will be able to add your products to lists that you have previously created. For example, you will be able to create a list called Fridge in which you will add the product Cheese or Yogurt.<br><br>When creating your product, you will be able to enter its name, the quantity of the product as well as its expiry date if the product has one. You can also choose a suitable Icon from a list of more than 1000 sorted Icons. Creating a list is similar, you will need to enter its name and choose an Icon.<br><br>The strength of the application is that all these products will automatically sort themselves according to their expiry date, to highlight products with an approaching expiry date. The products highlighted will be those to consume in priority.<br><br>There is a status system for products, determined by the number of days before their expiry date, for example, a product with an expired date will have an expired product status, a product with a very close expiry date will have an alert status. All these features can be changed in the app settings, including the number of days before expiration that will trigger the alerts. The application is intuitive and very easy to use for everyone.<br><br>Notifications are sent automatically when a product changes status. Again, these features are customizable in the app settings.<br><br>In addition to this, the application will allow you to have a complete inventory of the fridge and the cupboards, which is very practical, like while shopping, when you no longer remember what is missing and therefore what you should buy. The application is also very practical for being able to help you plan your meals for the week in advance, by optimizing the use of products with a near expiry date.<br><br>Less waste, less unnecessary spending of money, better management of your products, better organization for meals, recipe challenges with foods with close expiry dates, why not give this application a chance, which as a bonus, is super cute!<br><br>Together, let&#39;s say Stop and Fight against Food Waste, for the Planet, and our Wallet!<br><br>If you want to report a bug, ask a question, offer your help or just chat, you can be the first one to join my Discord server https://discord.gg/Y3taFX59KY<br><br>Or you can send me an email at the following address: contact@harderue.com<br><br>Harderue.",

A significant time saver, and a tool that can become essential daily. How it works ?<br><br>It&#39;s very easy, you will be able to create lists in which you will add your products. Products with an expiry date will be sorted according to this date to highlight those to be consumed first. Notifications may be sent to you to indicate that a product is approaching its expiry date.<br><br>The application is made in a very intuitive way and in such a way as to leave maximum freedom to the user. The creation of a list is very fast, all the fields are optional, you have the possibility to choose a super-cute icon among hundreds, choose to put a name, choose how the list will sort its products (by date of expiry, by name, by quantity), its position and much more. As you will have understood, the user will use the application as he wishes and will be able to use it in his own way, sometimes in a way that I have not even thought of!<br><br>Creating a product is just as easy except there are more fields, the expiry date (if the product has one), the quantity of the product and much more.<br>Lists and products, and all the information resulting from them, can be modified at any time, and especially after their creation. You will be able to modify the quantity of a product as you consume it, its expiry date, the list in which it is and everything else you want.<br><br>Everything is done so that the user saves as much time as possible, you have a history of the products you have created, the fields can then be filled in for your greatest pleasure.<br><br>The application also provides a shopping list, adding items to it can be done in different ways. You can add an item the same way you add a product in a list, by filling in different fields of a small form (icon, name, quantity), all fields are optional. But also, directly by transferring an existing product from a list to the shopping list. The opposite will obviously be possible, you can transfer an item from the shopping list to the list of your choice.<br><br>The application will allow you to have a complete inventory of your home, you can add any product, it works for your pharmacy with your medicines, your animals with their treats and toys, etc.<br><br>Less waste, less unnecessary spending of money, better management of your products, better organization for meals, recipe challenges with foods with close expiry dates. A free application, made by a student in his free time for several months, what are you waiting for to try it?<br><br>If you want to report a bug, ask a question, offer your help or just chat, you can be the first to join my Discord server https://discord.gg/Y3taFX59KY<br><br>Or you can send me an email at the following address: contact@harderue.com<br><br>Together, let&#39;s say Stop and Fight Food Waste, for the Planet, and our Wallet!<br><br>Harderue.",

The opposite will obviously be possible, you can transfer an item from the shopping list to the list of your choice.<br><br>The application will allow you to have a complete inventory of your home, you can add any product, it works for your pharmacy with your medicines, your animals with their treats and toys, etc.<br><br>Less waste, less unnecessary spending of money, better management of your products, better organization for meals, recipe challenges with foods with close expiry dates. A free application, made by a student in his free time for several months, what are you waiting for to try it?<br><br>If you want to report a bug, ask a question, offer your help or just chat, you can be the first to join my Discord server https://discord.gg/Y3taFX59KY<br><br>Or you can send me an email at the following address: contact@harderue.com<br><br>Together, let&#39;s say Stop and Fight Food Waste, for the Planet, and our Wallet!<br><br>Harderue.",

Very easily and very quickly, the application will also help you manage your shopping list, your budget expenses and much more. Ability to share your inventory with other users in real time!<br><br>The application is in the form of an inventory, and more precisely of lists that you will be able to create (Fridge, Freezer, Pharmacy, Animals, Garage), the only limit being your imagination. Each list will sort its products according to the parameters that you will choose.<br><br>In each of the lists you can add all your products with several parameters, such as the expiry date, the quantity, the icon, the name, the price. Each product can, among other things, be created from the product history, moved between lists, transferred to the shopping list.<br><br>The application is multifunctional and makes it very easy to transfer a product between the shopping list and another list. Each new purchase is recorded and allows budget reports to be compiled by week, month and year.<br><br>All features of the application are editable, products, lists, recorded expenses, shopping list etc. Everything is done to provide the best user experience. I tried to make the application as intuitive as possible, super-easy to use, even for people who are less experienced with technology.<br><br>With Your Food and its intelligent inventory, it is now impossible to forget a perishable product at the back of the fridge or at the back of a cupboard. When its expiration date approaches, it will automatically move up its list to highlight it. The products to be consumed in priority will by default be moved up in the lists. Ultimately, reducing food waste will reduce expenses for perishable products, and therefore save money and time.<br><br>You have the possibility to save your inventory as well as all your data by logging in with your Google account. In this way it will be possible to recover your data in the event of loss of your device, but also to connect to all your devices (tablet in the kitchen, personal phone, etc.). Your inventory will be synchronized in real time on all the devices where you are connected. It is also possible to share their inventory with another user using their email address. The person will then be able to access your inventory, modify it, add items, always in real time, synchronized on all devices.<br><br>Less food waste, significant money savings, better management of your products, better organization for meals, recipe challenges with foods with close expiry dates. A free application, made by a student in his spare time for several months already, what are you waiting for to try it?<br><br>If you want to report a bug, ask a question, offer your help or just chat, you can be the first to join my Discord server https://discord.gg/Y3taFX59KY<br><br>Or you can send me an email at the following address: contact@harderue.com<br><br>Together, let&#39;s say Stop and Fight Food Waste, for the Planet, and our Wallet!<br><br>Harderue.",

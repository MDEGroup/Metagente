Our users also come from various cultures, including: Bengali, Hindi, Gujarati, Kannadiga, Malayalee, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, and multi-cultural backgrounds.<br><br>One common denominator in our users, regardless of their socio-cultural background, is that they are drawn to Jodi365&#39;s tag line: For quality singles!<br><br>For more information, please browse https://www.jodi365.com or call us at +91 934 JODI 365 (India) / +1 305 JODI 365 (USA).",

Our users also come from various cultures, including: Bengali, Hindi, Gujarati, Kannadiga, Malayalee, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, and multi-cultural backgrounds.<br><br>One common denominator in our users, regardless of their socio-cultural background, is that they are drawn to Jodi365&#39;s tag line: For quality singles!<br><br>For more information, please browse https://www.jodi365.com or call us at +91 934 JODI 365 (India) / +1 305 JODI 365 (USA).",

Our users also come from various cultures, including: Bengali, Hindi, Gujarati, Kannadiga, Malayalee, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, and multi-cultural backgrounds.<br><br>One common denominator in our users, regardless of their socio-cultural background, is that they are drawn to Jodi365&#39;s tag line: For quality singles!<br><br>For more information, please browse https://www.jodi365.com or call us at +91 934 JODI 365 (India) / +1 305 JODI 365 (USA).",

    "descriptionHtml": "<b>Jodi365 is a next-generation matchmaking platform for quality Indian singles.</b><br><br>It is designed to help genuine people <b>find the right match, at their own pace</b>:<br><li> whether they are ready for matrimony or shaadi, or even an engagement, in the near term<br></li><li> or want to get to know someone as friends first<br><br><b>Sign up today and get matched for free, once your profile has been manually screened and approved.</b><br><br>PS: Genuine singles appreciate our rigorous screening process!<br><br><b>Our story:</b><br>As someone who had long endured the prevailing matrimonial and Indian dating sites into his 30s, our founder and CEO, Dr Anil Kumar deeply understood the challenges faced by educated, single professionals in finding a compatible partner.<br><br>It is what motivated him, in the home stretch of his MBA program at Chicago Booth, to introduce a &quot;refreshingly different&quot; matchmaking app.<br><br>That took the form of Jodi365, which we describe as: <br><i>Conceived in Chicago. Created in Chennai. Catering to quality Indian singles worldwide.</i><br><br><b>Jodi365 has been live and serving single Indians and their involved families since mid-2011.</b> And we&#39;re pleased by how much it has been appreciated over the years!<br><br>Our users come from India, the US, Canada, the UK, SE Asia, the Middle East, and other countries with sizable Indian / South Asian communities. Our largest market is, of course, India, particularly Tier 1 and Tier 2 metros, and, increasingly, Tier 3 towns too.<br><br><b>Find someone from your own socio-cultural background:</b><br>Jodi365 appeals to people of diverse religious views, or even no religion. Our users also represent all Indian communities and mother tongues.<br><br>One common denominator in our users \u2013 regardless of their region, religion, native language, or community \u2013 is that they are drawn to Jodi365&#39;s tag line: For quality singles!<br><br><b>Jodi365 is a &quot;freemium&quot; app.</b> What that means:<br>There are basic things that you can do on the app for free. Value-added services \u2013 with benefits that help users find and connect with the right <i>jodi</i> sooner, whether for marriage or dating \u2013 are provided at additional cost.<br><br><b>What all you can do for FREE:</b><br>\u2022 Protect your name, email, phone number, and some sensitive profile info (e.g., date of birth, income, college, place of employment, and smoking/drinking habits) from being exposed to web search engines and any other user on the platform<br>\u2022 Keep your photos from being exposed to search engines \u2013 or even random users \u2013 and also blurred out to other users as desired<br><br>\u2022 Find and review suitable matches<br>\u2022 View matches&#39; photos if their privacy settings allow it<br>\u2022 Shortlist and express interest in matches<br><br>\u2022 Send a SecureDial\u2122 request to matches, to talk without exposing phone numbers<br>\u2022 Reply to chats initiated by matches<br>\u2022 Receive customer support via email or live chat<br><br>Further, all users who create an authentic profile and complete the selfie-video verification step receive a <b>complimentary week-long trial (\u20b9299 value) of our Quick Connect plan</b>.<br><br><b>Value-added services</b> \u2013 such as the ability to initiate chat with matches and talk to them without exposing phone numbers \u2013 <b>start at \u20b9999</b> for a month-long Quick Connect plan.<br><br><b>We also offer personalized services</b>, for those who may be more ready to tie the matrimonial knot in the near term, through an <b>Assisted Connect</b> plan.<br><br><b>As part of the personalized service, a dedicated relationship manager would</b>:<br>\u2022 Understand you and your life-partner preferences in depth<br>\u2022 Curate and review up to 5 handpicked matches with you every week<br>\u2022 Reach out to preferred matches on your behalf &amp; explore mutual interest and compatibility in time frames for marriage<br>\u2022 Make introductions as appropriate, facilitate a conversation, and arrange a meeting<br>\u2022 And provide support, through the matchmaking process, as a trusted intermediary<br><br><b>We look forward to helping you find your jodi on Jodi365, so that you won&#39;t need the app any more!</b></li>",

    "descriptionHtml": "<b>Jodi365 is a next-generation matchmaking platform for quality Indian singles.</b><br><br>It is designed to help genuine people <b>find the right match, at their own pace</b>:<br><li> whether they are ready for matrimony or shaadi, or even an engagement, in the near term<br></li><li> or want to get to know someone as friends first<br><br><b>Sign up today and get matched for free, once your profile has been manually screened and approved.</b><br><br>PS: Genuine singles appreciate our rigorous screening process!<br><br><b>Our story:</b><br>As someone who had long endured the prevailing matrimonial and Indian dating sites into his 30s, our founder and CEO, Dr Anil Kumar deeply understood the challenges faced by educated, single professionals in finding a compatible partner.<br><br>It is what motivated him, in the home stretch of his MBA program at Chicago Booth, to introduce a &quot;refreshingly different&quot; matchmaking app.<br><br>That took the form of Jodi365, which we describe as: <br><i>Conceived in Chicago. Created in Chennai. Catering to quality Indian singles worldwide.</i><br><br><b>Jodi365 has been live and serving single Indians and their involved families since mid-2011.</b> And we&#39;re pleased by how much it has been appreciated over the years!<br><br>Our users come from India, the US, Canada, the UK, SE Asia, the Middle East, and other countries with sizable Indian / South Asian communities. Our largest market is, of course, India, particularly Tier 1 and Tier 2 metros, and, increasingly, Tier 3 towns too.<br><br><b>Find someone from your own socio-cultural background:</b><br>Jodi365 appeals to people of diverse religious views, or even no religion. Our users also represent all Indian communities and mother tongues.<br><br>One common denominator in our users \u2013 regardless of their region, religion, native language, or community \u2013 is that they are drawn to Jodi365&#39;s tag line: For quality singles!<br><br><b>Jodi365 is a &quot;freemium&quot; app.</b> What that means:<br>There are basic things that you can do on the app for free. Value-added services \u2013 with benefits that help users find and connect with the right <i>jodi</i> sooner, whether for marriage or dating \u2013 are provided at additional cost.<br><br><b>What all you can do for FREE:</b><br>\u2022 Protect your name, email, phone number, and some sensitive profile info (e.g., date of birth, income, college, place of employment, and smoking/drinking habits) from being exposed to web search engines and any other user on the platform<br>\u2022 Keep your photos from being exposed to search engines \u2013 or even random users \u2013 and also blurred out to other users as desired<br><br>\u2022 Find and review suitable matches<br>\u2022 View matches&#39; photos if their privacy settings allow it<br>\u2022 Shortlist and express interest in matches<br><br>\u2022 Send a SecureDial\u2122 request to matches, to talk without exposing phone numbers<br>\u2022 Reply to chats initiated by matches<br>\u2022 Receive customer support via email or live chat<br><br>Further, all users who create an authentic profile and complete the selfie-video verification step receive a <b>complimentary week-long trial (\u20b9299 value) of our Quick Connect plan</b>.<br><br><b>Value-added services</b> \u2013 such as the ability to initiate chat with matches and talk to them without exposing phone numbers \u2013 <b>start at \u20b9999</b> for a month-long Quick Connect plan.<br><br><b>We also offer personalized services</b>, for those who may be more ready to tie the matrimonial knot in the near term, through an <b>Assisted Connect</b> plan.<br><br><b>As part of the personalized service, a dedicated relationship manager would</b>:<br>\u2022 Understand you and your life-partner preferences in depth<br>\u2022 Curate and review up to 5 handpicked matches with you every week<br>\u2022 Reach out to preferred matches on your behalf &amp; explore mutual interest and compatibility in time frames for marriage<br>\u2022 Make introductions as appropriate, facilitate a conversation, and arrange a meeting<br>\u2022 And provide support, through the matchmaking process, as a trusted intermediary<br><br><b>We look forward to helping you find your jodi on Jodi365, so that you won&#39;t need the app any more!</b></li>",

    "descriptionHtml": "<b>Jodi365 is a next-generation matchmaking platform for quality Indian singles.</b><br><br>It is designed to help genuine people <b>find the right match, at their own pace</b>:<br><li> whether they are ready for matrimony or shaadi, or even an engagement, in the near term<br></li><li> or want to get to know someone as friends first<br><br><b>Sign up today and get matched for free, once your profile has been manually screened and approved.</b><br><br>PS: Genuine singles appreciate our rigorous screening process!<br><br><b>Our story:</b><br>As someone who had long endured the prevailing matrimonial and Indian dating sites into his 30s, our founder and CEO, Dr Anil Kumar deeply understood the challenges faced by educated, single professionals in finding a compatible partner.<br><br>It is what motivated him, in the home stretch of his MBA program at Chicago Booth, to introduce a &quot;refreshingly different&quot; matchmaking app.<br><br>That took the form of Jodi365, which we describe as: <br><i>Conceived in Chicago. Created in Chennai. Catering to quality Indian singles worldwide.</i><br><br><b>Jodi365 has been live and serving single Indians and their involved families since mid-2011.</b> And we&#39;re pleased by how much it has been appreciated over the years!<br><br>Our users come from India, the US, Canada, the UK, SE Asia, the Middle East, and other countries with sizable Indian / South Asian communities. Our largest market is, of course, India, particularly Tier 1 and Tier 2 metros, and, increasingly, Tier 3 towns too.<br><br><b>Find someone from your own socio-cultural background:</b><br>Jodi365 appeals to people of diverse religious views, or even no religion. Our users also represent all Indian communities and mother tongues.<br><br>One common denominator in our users \u2013 regardless of their region, religion, native language, or community \u2013 is that they are drawn to Jodi365&#39;s tag line: For quality singles!<br><br><b>Jodi365 is a &quot;freemium&quot; app.</b> What that means:<br>There are basic things that you can do on the app for free. Value-added services \u2013 with benefits that help users find and connect with the right <i>jodi</i> sooner, whether for marriage or dating \u2013 are provided at additional cost.<br><br><b>What all you can do for FREE:</b><br>\u2022 Protect your name, email, phone number, and some sensitive profile info (e.g., date of birth, income, college, place of employment, and smoking/drinking habits) from being exposed to web search engines and any other user on the platform<br>\u2022 Keep your photos from being exposed to search engines \u2013 or even random users \u2013 and also blurred out to other users as desired<br><br>\u2022 Find and review suitable matches<br>\u2022 View matches&#39; photos if their privacy settings allow it<br>\u2022 Shortlist and express interest in matches<br><br>\u2022 Send a SecureDial\u2122 request to matches, to talk without exposing phone numbers<br>\u2022 Reply to chats initiated by matches<br>\u2022 Receive customer support via email or live chat<br><br>Further, all users who create an authentic profile and complete the selfie-video verification step receive a <b>complimentary week-long trial (\u20b9299 value) of our Quick Connect plan</b>.<br><br><b>Value-added services</b> \u2013 such as the ability to initiate chat with matches and talk to them without exposing phone numbers \u2013 <b>start at \u20b9999</b> for a month-long Quick Connect plan.<br><br><b>We also offer personalized services</b>, for those who may be more ready to tie the matrimonial knot in the near term, through an <b>Assisted Connect</b> plan.<br><br><b>As part of the personalized service, a dedicated relationship manager would</b>:<br>\u2022 Understand you and your life-partner preferences in depth<br>\u2022 Curate and review up to 5 handpicked matches with you every week<br>\u2022 Reach out to preferred matches on your behalf &amp; explore mutual interest and compatibility in time frames for marriage<br>\u2022 Make introductions as appropriate, facilitate a conversation, and arrange a meeting<br>\u2022 And provide support, through the matchmaking process, as a trusted intermediary<br><br><b>We look forward to helping you find your jodi on Jodi365, so that you won&#39;t need the app any more!</b></li>",

Created in Chennai. Catering to quality Indian singles worldwide.</i><br><br><b>Jodi365 has been live and serving single Indians and their involved families since mid-2011.</b><br><br>And we&#39;re pleased by how Jodi365 has come to be appreciated as a smart, sensible hybrid between matrimony and dating apps.<br><br>Our users are primarily from India, of course\u2014particularly the Tier 1 and Tier 2 metros, and, increasingly, Tier 3 towns too.<br><br>Yet, our user base also includes NRIs from the US, Canada, the UK, SE Asia, the Middle East, and other countries with sizable South Asian communities.<br><br><b>Find someone from your own socio-cultural background:</b><br>Jodi365 appeals to people of diverse religious views, or even no religion. Our users also represent all Indian communities and mother tongues.<br><br>One common denominator in our users \u2013 regardless of their region, religion, native language, or community \u2013 is that they are drawn to Jodi365&#39;s tag line: For quality singles!<br><br><b>Jodi365 is a &quot;freemium&quot; app.</b> What that means:<br>There are basic things that you can do on the app for free.

Created in Chennai.

Our users also represent all Indian communities and mother tongues.<br><br>One common denominator in our users \u2013 regardless of their region, religion, native language, or community \u2013 is that they are drawn to Jodi365&#39;s tag line: For quality singles!<br><br><b>Jodi365 is a &quot;freemium&quot; app.</b> What that means:<br>There are basic things that you can do on the app for free.

Created in Chennai. Catering to quality Indian singles worldwide.</i><br><br><b>Jodi365 has been live and serving single Indians and their involved families since mid-2011.</b><br><br>And we&#39;re pleased by how Jodi365 has come to be appreciated as a smart, sensible hybrid between matrimony and dating apps.<br><br>Our users are primarily from India, of course\u2014particularly the Tier 1 and Tier 2 metros, and, increasingly, Tier 3 towns too.<br><br>Yet, our user base also includes NRIs from the US, Canada, the UK, SE Asia, the Middle East, and other countries with sizable South Asian communities.<br><br><b>Find someone from your own socio-cultural background:</b><br>Jodi365 appeals to people of diverse religious views, or even no religion. Our users also represent all Indian communities and mother tongues.<br><br>One common denominator in our users \u2013 regardless of their region, religion, native language, or community \u2013 is that they are drawn to Jodi365&#39;s tag line: For quality singles!<br><br><b>Jodi365 is a &quot;freemium&quot; app.</b> What that means:<br>There are basic things that you can do on the app for free.

    "descriptionHtml": "Jodi365 is an exclusive matchmaking app for singles who are alumni of top colleges and universities.  Because quality matters.<br><br>What differentiates Jodi365 from typical matrimonial &amp; casual dating apps:<br><br>Jodi365 is a smart, sensible hybrid between matrimonial sites and dating apps, designed to help elite singles to find the right match at their own pace:<br><li> whether they are ready for matrimony or shaadi, or even an engagement, in the near term<br></li><li> or want to get to know someone special as friends first<br><br>We carefully screen each applicant and are selective about whom we let into our curated community of verified members.<br><br>Our members are predominantly graduates of not just the IITs, IIMs, and the Ivy Leagues.  They come from elite institutions in varied fields, including the arts, science, civil services, engineering, medicine, law, management, business, account, finance, marketing, design, media, and more.<br><br>Our story, in the words of our founder and CEO:<br><br>&quot;I have personally known the challenges that educated, driven career professionals face in finding a compatible partner. That is what motivated me, in the home stretch of my MBA program at Chicago Booth, in 2009, to provide a thoughtful, refreshingly different matchmaking service.<br><br>I am grateful for how much Jodi365 has grown since then and for its continuing to earn the trust of thousands of new users each month.&quot;<br><br>\u2013 S. Anil Kumar<br>U Chicago (MBA), U Michigan (PhD), U Iowa (MS), IIT Madras (BTech)<br><br>Our users are primarily from India, of course\u2014particularly Tier 1 and Tier 2 metros and, increasingly, Tier 3 towns too.<br><br>Yet, our user base also includes NRIs and hyphenated Indians from the US, Canada, the UK, SE Asia, the Middle East, and other countries with sizable South Asian communities.<br><br>Find someone from your own socio-cultural background:<br><br>Jodi365 appeals to people of diverse religious views, or even no religion. Our users also represent all Indian communities and mother tongues.<br><br>One common denominator in our users \u2013 regardless of their region, religion, native language, or community \u2013 is that they are drawn to Jodi365&#39;s tag line: For quality singles!<br><br>They are also serious about finding that special someone.<br><br>If you are, too, and fit our eligibility criteria, then you are welcome to apply to join our exclusive community.<br><br>Genuine singles appreciate our detailed profile questionnaire and rigorous screening process.  They also appreciate our principle, &quot;You own your data. We respect that.&quot;   (Our business model is based on member subscriptions and doesn&#39;t involve renting or sharing user data.  Further, if an applicant is not approved or when a member no longer needs our services, we retain no personally identifiable information.)<br><br>Jodi365 is unabashedly a premium app, designed with care for those who value quality over quantity, for discerning singles who appreciate that choosing a life partner is the most important decision one can make in life.<br><br>Yet, we invite screened and verified members to get a free taste of our services before deciding on a membership plan, which starts at \u20b99,600.<br><br>Why people trust and feel safe on Jodi365:<br><br>We strive to admit only educated, quality singles, protect your privacy, and help to keep you safe.<br><br>Our discreet approach to matchmaking (see our app listing gallery here and details at Jodi365.com) is, not surprisingly, heartening and reassuring to genuine singles who are fed up of fake profiles and randos on other apps and also to &quot;high-visibility&quot; professionals and HNIs who don&#39;t even want to be spotted online.<br><br>We also offer personalized services, for busy and/or discriminating individuals who would welcome expert assistance from a dedicated relationship manager.  (The service entails our presenting handpicked matches for your review, getting more background info on prospects, and personally introducing you to matches, as appropriate.)<br><br>We look forward to helping you find your jodi on Jodi365, so that you won&#39;t need the app any more!</li>",

    "descriptionHtml": "Jodi365 is an exclusive matchmaking app for singles who are alumni of top colleges and universities.  Because quality matters.<br><br>What differentiates Jodi365 from typical matrimonial &amp; casual dating apps:<br><br>Jodi365 is a smart, sensible hybrid between matrimonial sites and dating apps, designed to help elite singles to find the right match at their own pace:<br><li> whether they are ready for matrimony or shaadi, or even an engagement, in the near term<br></li><li> or want to get to know someone special as friends first<br><br>We carefully screen each applicant and are selective about whom we let into our curated community of verified members.<br><br>Our members are predominantly graduates of not just the IITs, IIMs, and the Ivy Leagues.  They come from elite institutions in varied fields, including the arts, science, civil services, engineering, medicine, law, management, business, account, finance, marketing, design, media, and more.<br><br>Our story, in the words of our founder and CEO:<br><br>&quot;I have personally known the challenges that educated, driven career professionals face in finding a compatible partner. That is what motivated me, in the home stretch of my MBA program at Chicago Booth, in 2009, to provide a thoughtful, refreshingly different matchmaking service.<br><br>I am grateful for how much Jodi365 has grown since then and for its continuing to earn the trust of thousands of new users each month.&quot;<br><br>\u2013 S. Anil Kumar<br>U Chicago (MBA), U Michigan (PhD), U Iowa (MS), IIT Madras (BTech)<br><br>Our users are primarily from India, of course\u2014particularly Tier 1 and Tier 2 metros and, increasingly, Tier 3 towns too.<br><br>Yet, our user base also includes NRIs and hyphenated Indians from the US, Canada, the UK, SE Asia, the Middle East, and other countries with sizable South Asian communities.<br><br>Find someone from your own socio-cultural background:<br><br>Jodi365 appeals to people of diverse religious views, or even no religion. Our users also represent all Indian communities and mother tongues.<br><br>One common denominator in our users \u2013 regardless of their region, religion, native language, or community \u2013 is that they are drawn to Jodi365&#39;s tag line: For quality singles!<br><br>They are also serious about finding that special someone.<br><br>If you are, too, and fit our eligibility criteria, then you are welcome to apply to join our exclusive community.<br><br>Genuine singles appreciate our detailed profile questionnaire and rigorous screening process.  They also appreciate our principle, &quot;You own your data. We respect that.&quot;   (Our business model is based on member subscriptions and doesn&#39;t involve renting or sharing user data.  Further, if an applicant is not approved or when a member no longer needs our services, we retain no personally identifiable information.)<br><br>Jodi365 is unabashedly a premium app, designed with care for those who value quality over quantity, for discerning singles who appreciate that choosing a life partner is the most important decision one can make in life.<br><br>Yet, we invite screened and verified members to get a free taste of our services before deciding on a membership plan, which starts at \u20b99,600.<br><br>Why people trust and feel safe on Jodi365:<br><br>We strive to admit only educated, quality singles, protect your privacy, and help to keep you safe.<br><br>Our discreet approach to matchmaking (see our app listing gallery here and details at Jodi365.com) is, not surprisingly, heartening and reassuring to genuine singles who are fed up of fake profiles and randos on other apps and also to &quot;high-visibility&quot; professionals and HNIs who don&#39;t even want to be spotted online.<br><br>We also offer personalized services, for busy and/or discriminating individuals who would welcome expert assistance from a dedicated relationship manager.  (The service entails our presenting handpicked matches for your review, getting more background info on prospects, and personally introducing you to matches, as appropriate.)<br><br>We look forward to helping you find your jodi on Jodi365, so that you won&#39;t need the app any more!</li>",

    "descriptionHtml": "Jodi365 is an exclusive matchmaking app for singles who are alumni of top colleges and universities.  Because quality matters.<br><br>What differentiates Jodi365 from typical matrimonial &amp; casual dating apps:<br><br>Jodi365 is a smart, sensible hybrid between matrimonial sites and dating apps, designed to help elite singles to find the right match at their own pace:<br><li> whether they are ready for matrimony or shaadi, or even an engagement, in the near term<br></li><li> or want to get to know someone special as friends first<br><br>We carefully screen each applicant and are selective about whom we let into our curated community of verified members.<br><br>Our members are predominantly graduates of not just the IITs, IIMs, and the Ivy Leagues.  They come from elite institutions in varied fields, including the arts, science, civil services, engineering, medicine, law, management, business, account, finance, marketing, design, media, and more.<br><br>Our story, in the words of our founder and CEO:<br><br>&quot;I have personally known the challenges that educated, driven career professionals face in finding a compatible partner. That is what motivated me, in the home stretch of my MBA program at Chicago Booth, in 2009, to provide a thoughtful, refreshingly different matchmaking service.<br><br>I am grateful for how much Jodi365 has grown since then and for its continuing to earn the trust of thousands of new users each month.&quot;<br><br>\u2013 S. Anil Kumar<br>U Chicago (MBA), U Michigan (PhD), U Iowa (MS), IIT Madras (BTech)<br><br>Our users are primarily from India, of course\u2014particularly Tier 1 and Tier 2 metros and, increasingly, Tier 3 towns too.<br><br>Yet, our user base also includes NRIs and hyphenated Indians from the US, Canada, the UK, SE Asia, the Middle East, and other countries with sizable South Asian communities.<br><br>Find someone from your own socio-cultural background:<br><br>Jodi365 appeals to people of diverse religious views, or even no religion. Our users also represent all Indian communities and mother tongues.<br><br>One common denominator in our users \u2013 regardless of their region, religion, native language, or community \u2013 is that they are drawn to Jodi365&#39;s tag line: For quality singles!<br><br>They are also serious about finding that special someone.<br><br>If you are, too, and fit our eligibility criteria, then you are welcome to apply to join our exclusive community.<br><br>Genuine singles appreciate our detailed profile questionnaire and rigorous screening process.  They also appreciate our principle, &quot;You own your data. We respect that.&quot;   (Our business model is based on member subscriptions and doesn&#39;t involve renting or sharing user data.  Further, if an applicant is not approved or when a member no longer needs our services, we retain no personally identifiable information.)<br><br>Jodi365 is unabashedly a premium app, designed with care for those who value quality over quantity, for discerning singles who appreciate that choosing a life partner is the most important decision one can make in life.<br><br>Yet, we invite screened and verified members to get a free taste of our services before deciding on a membership plan, which starts at \u20b99,600.<br><br>Why people trust and feel safe on Jodi365:<br><br>We strive to admit only educated, quality singles, protect your privacy, and help to keep you safe.<br><br>Our discreet approach to matchmaking (see our app listing gallery here and details at Jodi365.com) is, not surprisingly, heartening and reassuring to genuine singles who are fed up of fake profiles and randos on other apps and also to &quot;high-visibility&quot; professionals and HNIs who don&#39;t even want to be spotted online.<br><br>We also offer personalized services, for busy and/or discriminating individuals who would welcome expert assistance from a dedicated relationship manager.  (The service entails our presenting handpicked matches for your review, getting more background info on prospects, and personally introducing you to matches, as appropriate.)<br><br>We look forward to helping you find your jodi on Jodi365, so that you won&#39;t need the app any more!</li>",

Because quality matters.<br><br>What differentiates Jodi365 from typical matrimonial &amp; casual dating apps:<br><br>Jodi365 is a smart, sensible hybrid between matrimonial sites and dating apps, designed to help elite singles to find the right match at their own pace:<br><li> whether they are ready for matrimony or shaadi, or even an engagement, in the near term<br></li><li> or want to get to know someone special as friends first<br><br>We carefully screen each applicant and are selective about whom we let into our curated community of verified members.<br><br>Our members are predominantly graduates of not just the IITs, IIMs, and the Ivy Leagues.  They come from elite institutions in varied fields, including the arts, science, civil services, engineering, medicine, law, management, business, account, finance, marketing, design, media, and more.<br><br>Our story, in the words of our founder and CEO:<br><br>&quot;I have personally known the challenges that educated, driven career professionals face in finding a compatible partner. That is what motivated me, in the home stretch of my MBA program at Chicago Booth, in 2009, to provide a thoughtful, refreshingly different matchmaking service.<br><br>I am grateful for how much Jodi365 has grown since then and for its continuing to earn the trust of thousands of new users each month.&quot;<br><br>\u2013 S.

    "descriptionHtml": "Jodi365 is an exclusive matchmaking app for singles who are alumni of top colleges and universities.  Because quality matters.<br><br>What differentiates Jodi365 from typical matrimonial &amp; casual dating apps:<br><br>Jodi365 is a smart, sensible hybrid between matrimonial sites and dating apps, designed to help elite singles to find the right match at their own pace:<br><li> whether they are ready for matrimony or shaadi, or even an engagement, in the near term<br></li><li> or want to get to know someone special as friends first<br><br>We carefully screen each applicant and are selective about whom we let into our curated community of verified members.<br><br>Our members are predominantly graduates of not just the IITs, IIMs, and the Ivy Leagues.  They come from elite institutions in varied fields, including the arts, science, civil services, engineering, medicine, law, management, business, account, finance, marketing, design, media, and more.<br><br>Our story, in the words of our founder and CEO:<br><br>&quot;I have personally known the challenges that educated, driven career professionals face in finding a compatible partner. That is what motivated me, in the home stretch of my MBA program at Chicago Booth, in 2009, to provide a thoughtful, refreshingly different matchmaking service.<br><br>I am grateful for how much Jodi365 has grown since then and for its continuing to earn the trust of thousands of new users each month.&quot;<br><br>\u2013 S. Anil Kumar<br>U Chicago (MBA), U Michigan (PhD), U Iowa (MS), IIT Madras (BTech)<br><br>Our users are primarily from India, of course\u2014particularly Tier 1 and Tier 2 metros and, increasingly, Tier 3 towns too.<br><br>Yet, our user base also includes NRIs and hyphenated Indians from the US, Canada, the UK, SE Asia, the Middle East, and other countries with sizable South Asian communities.<br><br>Find someone from your own socio-cultural background:<br><br>Jodi365 appeals to people of diverse religious views, or even no religion. Our users also represent all Indian communities and mother tongues.<br><br>One common denominator in our users \u2013 regardless of their region, religion, native language, or community \u2013 is that they are drawn to Jodi365&#39;s tag line: For quality singles!<br><br>They are also serious about finding that special someone.<br><br>If you are, too, and fit our eligibility criteria, then you are welcome to apply to join our exclusive community.<br><br>Genuine singles appreciate our detailed profile questionnaire and rigorous screening process.  They also appreciate our principle, &quot;You own your data. We respect that.&quot;   (Our business model is based on member subscriptions and doesn&#39;t involve renting or sharing user data.  Further, if an applicant is not approved or when a member no longer needs our services, we retain no personally identifiable information.)<br><br>Jodi365 is unabashedly a premium app, designed with care for those who value quality over quantity, for discerning singles who appreciate that choosing a life partner is the most important decision one can make in life.<br><br>Yet, we invite screened and verified members to get a free taste of our services before deciding on a membership plan, which starts at \u20b99,600.<br><br>Why people trust and feel safe on Jodi365:<br><br>We strive to admit only educated, quality singles, protect your privacy, and help to keep you safe.<br><br>Our discreet approach to matchmaking (see our app listing gallery here and details at Jodi365.com) is, not surprisingly, heartening and reassuring to genuine singles who are fed up of fake profiles and randos on other apps and also to &quot;high-visibility&quot; professionals and HNIs who don&#39;t even want to be spotted online.<br><br>We also offer personalized services, for busy and/or discriminating individuals who would welcome expert assistance from a dedicated relationship manager.  (The service entails our presenting handpicked matches for your review, getting more background info on prospects, and personally introducing you to matches, as appropriate.)<br><br>We look forward to helping you find your jodi on Jodi365, so that you won&#39;t need the app any more!</li>",

    "descriptionHtml": "Jodi365 is an exclusive matchmaking app for singles who are alumni of top colleges and universities.  Because quality matters.<br><br>What differentiates Jodi365 from typical matrimonial &amp; casual dating apps:<br><br>Jodi365 is a smart, sensible hybrid between matrimonial sites and dating apps, designed to help elite singles to find the right match at their own pace:<br><li> whether they are ready for matrimony or shaadi, or even an engagement, in the near term<br></li><li> or want to get to know someone special as friends first<br><br>We carefully screen each applicant and are selective about whom we let into our curated community of verified members.<br><br>Our members are predominantly graduates of not just the IITs, IIMs, and the Ivy Leagues.  They come from elite institutions in varied fields, including the arts, science, civil services, engineering, medicine, law, management, business, account, finance, marketing, design, media, and more.<br><br>Our story, in the words of our founder and CEO:<br><br>&quot;I have personally known the challenges that educated, driven career professionals face in finding a compatible partner. That is what motivated me, in the home stretch of my MBA program at Chicago Booth, in 2009, to provide a thoughtful, refreshingly different matchmaking service.<br><br>I am grateful for how much Jodi365 has grown since then and for its continuing to earn the trust of thousands of new users each month.&quot;<br><br>\u2013 S. Anil Kumar<br>U Chicago (MBA), U Michigan (PhD), U Iowa (MS), IIT Madras (BTech)<br><br>Our users are primarily from India, of course\u2014particularly Tier 1 and Tier 2 metros and, increasingly, Tier 3 towns too.<br><br>Yet, our user base also includes NRIs and hyphenated Indians from the US, Canada, the UK, SE Asia, the Middle East, and other countries with sizable South Asian communities.<br><br>Find someone from your own socio-cultural background:<br><br>Jodi365 appeals to people of diverse religious views, or even no religion. Our users also represent all Indian communities and mother tongues.<br><br>One common denominator in our users \u2013 regardless of their region, religion, native language, or community \u2013 is that they are drawn to Jodi365&#39;s tag line: For quality singles!<br><br>They are also serious about finding that special someone.<br><br>If you are, too, and fit our eligibility criteria, then you are welcome to apply to join our exclusive community.<br><br>Genuine singles appreciate our detailed profile questionnaire and rigorous screening process.  They also appreciate our principle, &quot;You own your data. We respect that.&quot;   (Our business model is based on member subscriptions and doesn&#39;t involve renting or sharing user data.  Further, if an applicant is not approved or when a member no longer needs our services, we retain no personally identifiable information.)<br><br>Jodi365 is unabashedly a premium app, designed with care for those who value quality over quantity, for discerning singles who appreciate that choosing a life partner is the most important decision one can make in life.<br><br>Yet, we invite screened and verified members to get a free taste of our services before deciding on a membership plan, which starts at \u20b99,600.<br><br>Why people trust and feel safe on Jodi365:<br><br>We strive to admit only educated, quality singles, protect your privacy, and help to keep you safe.<br><br>Our discreet approach to matchmaking (see our app listing gallery here and details at Jodi365.com) is, not surprisingly, heartening and reassuring to genuine singles who are fed up of fake profiles and randos on other apps and also to &quot;high-visibility&quot; professionals and HNIs who don&#39;t even want to be spotted online.<br><br>We also offer personalized services, for busy and/or discriminating individuals who would welcome expert assistance from a dedicated relationship manager.  (The service entails our presenting handpicked matches for your review, getting more background info on prospects, and personally introducing you to matches, as appropriate.)<br><br>We look forward to helping you find your jodi on Jodi365, so that you won&#39;t need the app any more!</li>",

    "descriptionHtml": "Jodi365 is an exclusive matchmaking app for singles who are alumni of top colleges and universities.  Because quality matters.<br><br>What differentiates Jodi365 from typical matrimonial &amp; casual dating apps:<br><br>Jodi365 is a smart, sensible hybrid between matrimonial sites and dating apps, designed to help elite singles to find the right match at their own pace:<br><li> whether they are ready for matrimony or shaadi, or even an engagement, in the near term<br></li><li> or want to get to know someone special as friends first<br><br>We carefully screen each applicant and are selective about whom we let into our curated community of verified members.<br><br>Our members are predominantly graduates of not just the IITs, IIMs, and the Ivy Leagues.  They come from elite institutions in varied fields, including the arts, science, civil services, engineering, medicine, law, management, business, account, finance, marketing, design, media, and more.<br><br>Our story, in the words of our founder and CEO:<br><br>&quot;I have personally known the challenges that educated, driven career professionals face in finding a compatible partner. That is what motivated me, in the home stretch of my MBA program at Chicago Booth, in 2009, to provide a thoughtful, refreshingly different matchmaking service.<br><br>I am grateful for how much Jodi365 has grown since then and for its continuing to earn the trust of thousands of new users each month.&quot;<br><br>\u2013 S. Anil Kumar<br>U Chicago (MBA), U Michigan (PhD), U Iowa (MS), IIT Madras (BTech)<br><br>Our users are primarily from India, of course\u2014particularly Tier 1 and Tier 2 metros and, increasingly, Tier 3 towns too.<br><br>Yet, our user base also includes NRIs and hyphenated Indians from the US, Canada, the UK, SE Asia, the Middle East, and other countries with sizable South Asian communities.<br><br>Find someone from your own socio-cultural background:<br><br>Jodi365 appeals to people of diverse religious views, or even no religion. Our users also represent all Indian communities and mother tongues.<br><br>One common denominator in our users \u2013 regardless of their region, religion, native language, or community \u2013 is that they are drawn to Jodi365&#39;s tag line: For quality singles!<br><br>They are also serious about finding that special someone.<br><br>If you are, too, and fit our eligibility criteria, then you are welcome to apply to join our exclusive community.<br><br>Genuine singles appreciate our detailed profile questionnaire and rigorous screening process.  They also appreciate our principle, &quot;You own your data. We respect that.&quot;   (Our business model is based on member subscriptions and doesn&#39;t involve renting or sharing user data.  Further, if an applicant is not approved or when a member no longer needs our services, we retain no personally identifiable information.)<br><br>Jodi365 is unabashedly a premium app, designed with care for those who value quality over quantity, for discerning singles who appreciate that choosing a life partner is the most important decision one can make in life.<br><br>Yet, we invite screened and verified members to get a free taste of our services before deciding on a membership plan, which starts at \u20b99,600.<br><br>Why people trust and feel safe on Jodi365:<br><br>We strive to admit only educated, quality singles, protect your privacy, and help to keep you safe.<br><br>Our discreet approach to matchmaking (see our app listing gallery here and details at Jodi365.com) is, not surprisingly, heartening and reassuring to genuine singles who are fed up of fake profiles and randos on other apps and also to &quot;high-visibility&quot; professionals and HNIs who don&#39;t even want to be spotted online.<br><br>We also offer personalized services, for busy and/or discriminating individuals who would welcome expert assistance from a dedicated relationship manager.  (The service entails our presenting handpicked matches for your review, getting more background info on prospects, and personally introducing you to matches, as appropriate.)<br><br>We look forward to helping you find your jodi on Jodi365, so that you won&#39;t need the app any more!</li>",

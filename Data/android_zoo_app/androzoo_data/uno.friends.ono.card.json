    "descriptionHtml": "Ono is a simple Crazy Eights-style card game, with a bunch of strategy cards thrown in to make it interesting. The best part is that Ono is a FREE game!<br><br>Brace yourself for the fast paced Ono Crazy card game. The idea of the game is to get to your last card, shout Ono before another player realises you didn\u2019t, and then attempt to play your last card on your turn to win the round. The player to use up the last card wins the round and is scored based on the cards left in their opponent\u2019s hand.<br><br>Each player is dealt 7 cards with the remaining ones placed face down to form a draw pile. The top card of the draw pile is turned over to begin a discard pile.<br><br>The objective of the game is to be the first player to shout Ono. Points are scored by ridding yourself of all the cards in your hand before your opponents. You score points for cards left in your opponent&#39;s hands.<br><br>The first player has to match the card in the discard pile either by number, color or word or the player can throw down a Wild Card. If the player doesn&#39;t have anything to match, he must pick a card from the draw pile. If he can play what is drawn, great. Otherwise play moves to the next person.<br><br>Wild Card gives the players a chance to experience an all new game changing experience!<br>When you have one card left, you must shout Ono (meaning one). Failure to do this results in you having to pick two cards from the draw pile. That is, of course if you get caught by the other players.<br><br>It&#39;s the number and color matching game of cards that&#39;s fun and easy for kids of all ages, all for free.<br><br>Ono Crazy Card Game is challenging and enjoyable for card players of any skill level and age. When it comes to fun games for the whole family, Ono is the family game that provides hours of entertainment for all.<br><br>Like most card games, Ono trains concentration, memory, and reaction time.<br>It&#39;s a fun game to have available when everyone is sitting around bored, looking for something to do.<br><br>Unlike lots of other games, Ono Crazy Card Game is still fun even when you have played it many times.<br><br>Download Ono Free for your phone and tablets today and have endless hours of fun.<br><br>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Ono Crazy card game Features \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<br><br>\u2756 Three strategic AI players<br>\u2756 3 action cards and 2 Wild cards <br>\u2756 Extremely rich UI<br>\u2756 Online And Offline Gameplay <br>\u2756 Play on Private Tables with friends and family<br><br>Don\u2019t forget to Rate and Review Ono so that we can make the game better! <br>Enjoy playing Ono!!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Earcare is a hearing aid app for Android Bluetooth that uses phone microphone, headset mic or Bluetooth mic to boost the sounds around you to help you hear conversations and surrounding sounds louder and clearer. Earcare hearing aid app for Android Bluetooth enhances sound from your environment and streams to your wired and Bluetooth listening devices for better hearing. The hearing aid app for Android Bluetooth is useful for people who have difficulty hearing conversation when other people are talking or there is significant background noise. Earcare hearing aid helps you hear voices and human speech louder and clearer.<br><br>Earcare hearing aid app enhances external sound for your ears. The hearing aid app for Android Bluetooth can be used by hearing-impaired people who have difficulty hearing conversations when other people are talking. The hearing aid app for Android Bluetooth makes voices louder and allows you to reduce unwanted background noise to make sound clear for your ears. Human speech and voice signals are amplified while noise is suppressed.<br><br>WHY EARCARE?<br>1. Use your phone or headset as a hearing aid to solve your hearing problems (such as hearing loss) if you cannot afford expensive prescription hearing aids, or as temporary hearing aid when you\u2019ve lost your medical hearing aid device.<br>2. Hear conversations better by boosting important sounds and reducing unwanted background noise.<br>3. Hear your surroundings from afar, or know what\u2019s happening around you to detect danger and protect your properties or kids.<br>4. Hear TV louder while the volume remains the same for others. No need to ask people to turn up or increase the TV volume. Simply connect Bluetooth headphones, move up the boost slider, and place your phone near the TV to hear louder.<br>5. Listen and record lectures (at the same time) from back of the class.<br>6. Record sounds from your surroundings.<br>7. Stop asking people to repeat what they said to avoid frustration and embarrassment. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d and \u201cCan you repeat that?\u201d are phrases of the past. With Earcare hearing aid you can hear comfortably.<br><br>Listen with any wired or wireless listening device, including earphones, Bluetooth headset, wired headphones and earbuds.

    "descriptionHtml": "Earcare is a hearing aid app for Android Bluetooth that uses phone microphone, headset mic or Bluetooth mic to boost the sounds around you to help you hear conversations and surrounding sounds louder and clearer. Earcare hearing aid app for Android Bluetooth enhances sound from your environment and streams to your wired and Bluetooth listening devices for better hearing. The hearing aid app for Android Bluetooth is useful for people who have difficulty hearing conversation when other people are talking or there is significant background noise. Earcare hearing aid helps you hear voices and human speech louder and clearer.<br><br>Earcare hearing aid app enhances external sound for your ears. The hearing aid app for Android Bluetooth can be used by hearing-impaired people who have difficulty hearing conversations when other people are talking. The hearing aid app for Android Bluetooth makes voices louder and allows you to reduce unwanted background noise to make sound clear for your ears. Human speech and voice signals are amplified while noise is suppressed.<br><br>WHY EARCARE?<br>1. Use your phone or headset as a hearing aid to solve your hearing problems (such as hearing loss) if you cannot afford expensive prescription hearing aids, or as temporary hearing aid when you\u2019ve lost your medical hearing aid device.<br>2. Hear conversations better by boosting important sounds and reducing unwanted background noise.<br>3. Hear your surroundings from afar, or know what\u2019s happening around you to detect danger and protect your properties or kids.<br>4. Hear TV louder while the volume remains the same for others. No need to ask people to turn up or increase the TV volume. Simply connect Bluetooth headphones, move up the boost slider, and place your phone near the TV to hear louder.<br>5. Listen and record lectures (at the same time) from back of the class.<br>6. Record sounds from your surroundings.<br>7. Stop asking people to repeat what they said to avoid frustration and embarrassment. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d and \u201cCan you repeat that?\u201d are phrases of the past.

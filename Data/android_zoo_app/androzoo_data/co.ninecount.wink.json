It\u2019s as easy as swiping right and starting up a conversation with your potential new bestie.<br><br>So...what exactly do you do on the Wink app?<br><br>SWIPE<br>Swipe right and left through a bunch of new faces! Does that guy have the same quote in his bio as you do?! SWIPE RIGHT! Instant friends. She likes the soccer team that you hate the most?! SWIPE LEFT! No chance of a friendship there! On Wink, you can meet new friends in your country and around the world. You can add them on Snapchat, or start up a conversation right on Wink. You\u2019ll see tons of new faces, read about them in their bios, and decide who you really want to be Wink friends or snap friends with!

If you keep earning gems, unlimited friends is truly what there is on Wink.<br><br>Basically, what I\u2019m trying to say is... you can never have too many friends.

You\u2019ll also have even more people to start snap streaks with (just make sure to keep those alive)!<br><br>Say yolo and just do it. Download the Wink app, put yourself out there, and see all of the cool people you can find by sitting there and mindlessly swiping while you watch TV even though you\u2019re supposed to be doing homework. What do you have to lose? Go meet people to become friends with!!<br><br>PS - Wink is for friendships ONLY.

Does that guy have the same quote in his bio as you do?! SWIPE RIGHT! Instant friends. She likes the soccer team that you hate the most?! SWIPE LEFT! No chance of a friendship there! On Wink, you can meet new friends in your country and around the world. You can add them on Snapchat, or start up a conversation right on Wink.

    "descriptionHtml": "Wink: Unlimited friends! Wink is the best place to make new friends from all over the world. It\u2019s as easy as swiping right and starting up a conversation with your potential new bestie.<br><br>So...what exactly do you do on the Wink app?<br><br>SWIPE<br>Swipe right and left through a bunch of new faces! Does that girl love soccer too? SWIPE RIGHT! Instant friends. She likes the kind of music that you hate the most? SWIPE LEFT! No chance of a friendship there. On Wink, you can meet new friends in your country and around the world. You can start up  the conversation right on Wink, and add them on Snapchat too. You\u2019ll see tons of new faces, read about them in their bios, check out their interests, and decide who you really want to be Wink friends or snap friends with! Start swiping to meet your new pals!<br><br>ADD<br>When you request to add someone or they request to add you, Wink makes it super easy to add the new friends you\u2019re meeting to Wink and on Snapchat. With the click of a button, you become instantly connected! You go from a swipe on Wink, right to being friends!<br><br>CHAT<br>The fastest and safest way to chat with your new Wink friends is to start up the conversation right here on Wink! You have the option to add them on Snapchat as well, but why not chat a bit first? Get to know your new friends. Find out what you have in common! You can also use the messenger on Wink to send messages, audio messages, photos, ice breakers, GIFs, and even play games against each other. If you\u2019re looking for someone to talk to ASAP, try out Random Chat! You\u2019ll be instantly connected to someone new, and you\u2019ll have the option to add them as a friend from within the chat if you want to keep talking later! Who knows, someone you start messaging on Wink could become your lifelong best friend! <br><br>EARN<br>You have the opportunity to earn gems every day on Wink! What are the gems used for, you ask? You can use gems to send add requests to your new friends, or to click the back arrow when you may have missed someone. You can also use them in the WinkShop to buy a new background for your profile, or plant a tree in real life. Using your gems to make the world a better place? You\u2019re the best! Whether it\u2019s a daily check-in or sharing Wink with your existing snap friends, there are tons of ways to get more gems. Another way to get gems is to play super fun games in the Wink Arcade. The points you earn from the games will turn into gems! If you keep earning gems, unlimited friends is truly what you\u2019ll find on Wink.<br><br>Basically, what I\u2019m trying to say is... you can never have too many friends. And tbh, it can be hard to make friends sometimes. All the awkwardness and asking for numbers and Snapchats and whatever. Wink exists to help you easily put yourself out there, and find more and more people to make your life even more fun! All you have to do is create your profile, tell everyone who you are, and start to discover your future besties.<br><br>PS - Wink is for friendships ONLY. Thank you.<br><br>Safety disclaimer: Wink is intended to be used for making new friends from all over the world to add and chat with.

    "descriptionHtml": "Wink: Unlimited friends! Wink is the best place to make new friends from all over the world. It\u2019s as easy as swiping right and starting up a conversation with your potential new bestie.<br><br>So...what exactly do you do on the Wink app?<br><br>SWIPE<br>Swipe right and left through a bunch of new faces! Does that girl love soccer too? SWIPE RIGHT! Instant friends. She likes the kind of music that you hate the most? SWIPE LEFT! No chance of a friendship there. On Wink, you can meet new friends in your country and around the world. You can start up  the conversation right on Wink, and add them on Snapchat too. You\u2019ll see tons of new faces, read about them in their bios, check out their interests, and decide who you really want to be Wink friends or snap friends with! Start swiping to meet your new pals!<br><br>ADD<br>When you request to add someone or they request to add you, Wink makes it super easy to add the new friends you\u2019re meeting to Wink and on Snapchat. With the click of a button, you become instantly connected! You go from a swipe on Wink, right to being friends!<br><br>CHAT<br>The fastest and safest way to chat with your new Wink friends is to start up the conversation right here on Wink! You have the option to add them on Snapchat as well, but why not chat a bit first? Get to know your new friends. Find out what you have in common! You can also use the messenger on Wink to send messages, audio messages, photos, ice breakers, GIFs, and even play games against each other. If you\u2019re looking for someone to talk to ASAP, try out Random Chat! You\u2019ll be instantly connected to someone new, and you\u2019ll have the option to add them as a friend from within the chat if you want to keep talking later! Who knows, someone you start messaging on Wink could become your lifelong best friend! <br><br>EARN<br>You have the opportunity to earn gems every day on Wink! What are the gems used for, you ask? You can use gems to send add requests to your new friends, or to click the back arrow when you may have missed someone. You can also use them in the WinkShop to buy a new background for your profile, or plant a tree in real life. Using your gems to make the world a better place? You\u2019re the best! Whether it\u2019s a daily check-in or sharing Wink with your existing snap friends, there are tons of ways to get more gems. Another way to get gems is to play super fun games in the Wink Arcade. The points you earn from the games will turn into gems! If you keep earning gems, unlimited friends is truly what you\u2019ll find on Wink.<br><br>Basically, what I\u2019m trying to say is... you can never have too many friends. And tbh, it can be hard to make friends sometimes. All the awkwardness and asking for numbers and Snapchats and whatever. Wink exists to help you easily put yourself out there, and find more and more people to make your life even more fun! All you have to do is create your profile, tell everyone who you are, and start to discover your future besties.<br><br>PS - Wink is for friendships ONLY.

Does that girl love soccer too? SWIPE RIGHT! Instant friends. She likes the kind of music that you hate the most? SWIPE LEFT! No chance of a friendship there. On Wink, you can meet new friends in your country and around the world. You can start up  the conversation right on Wink, and add them on Snapchat too.

With the click of a button, you become instantly connected! You go from a swipe on Wink, right to being friends!<br><br>CHAT<br>The fastest and safest way to chat with your new Wink friends is to start up the conversation right here on Wink! You have the option to add them on Snapchat as well, but why not chat a bit first? Get to know your new friends. Find out what you have in common! You can also use the messenger on Wink to send messages, audio messages, photos, ice breakers, GIFs, and even play games against each other. If you\u2019re looking for someone to talk to ASAP, try out Random Chat!

    "descriptionHtml": "Wink: Unlimited friends! Wink is the best place to make new friends from all over the world. It\u2019s as easy as swiping right and starting up a conversation with your potential new bestie.<br><br>So...what exactly do you do on the Wink app?<br><br>SWIPE<br>Swipe right and left through a bunch of new faces! Does that girl love soccer too? SWIPE RIGHT! Instant friends. She likes the kind of music that you hate the most? SWIPE LEFT! No chance of a friendship there. On Wink, you can meet new friends in your country and around the world. You can start up  the conversation right on Wink, and add them on Snapchat too. You\u2019ll see tons of new faces, read about them in their bios, check out their interests, and decide who you really want to be Wink friends or snap friends with! Start swiping to meet your new pals!<br><br>ADD<br>When you request to add someone or they request to add you, Wink makes it super easy to add the new friends you\u2019re meeting to Wink and on Snapchat. With the click of a button, you become instantly connected! You go from a swipe on Wink, right to being friends!<br><br>CHAT<br>The fastest and safest way to chat with your new Wink friends is to start up the conversation right here on Wink! You have the option to add them on Snapchat as well, but why not chat a bit first? Get to know your new friends. Find out what you have in common! You can also use the messenger on Wink to send messages, audio messages, photos, ice breakers, GIFs, and even play games against each other. If you\u2019re looking for someone to talk to ASAP, try out Random Chat! You\u2019ll be instantly connected to someone new, and you\u2019ll have the option to add them as a friend from within the chat if you want to keep talking later! Who knows, someone you start messaging on Wink could become your lifelong best friend! <br><br>EARN<br>You have the opportunity to earn gems every day on Wink! What are the gems used for, you ask? You can use gems to send add requests to your new friends, or to click the back arrow when you may have missed someone. You can also use them in the WinkShop to buy a new background for your profile, or plant a tree in real life. Using your gems to make the world a better place? You\u2019re the best! Whether it\u2019s a daily check-in or sharing Wink with your existing snap friends, there are tons of ways to get more gems. Another way to get gems is to play super fun games in the Wink Arcade. The points you earn from the games will turn into gems! If you keep earning gems, unlimited friends is truly what you\u2019ll find on Wink.<br><br>Basically, what I\u2019m trying to say is... you can never have too many friends. And tbh, it can be hard to make friends sometimes. All the awkwardness and asking for numbers and Snapchats and whatever. Wink exists to help you easily put yourself out there, and find more and more people to make your life even more fun! All you have to do is create your profile, tell everyone who you are, and start to discover your future besties.<br><br>PS - Wink is for friendships ONLY.

    "descriptionHtml": "Wink: Unlimited friends! Wink is the best place to make new friends from all over the world. It\u2019s as easy as swiping right and starting up a conversation with your potential new bestie.<br><br>So...what exactly do you do on the Wink app?<br><br>SWIPE<br>Swipe right and left through a bunch of new faces! Does that girl love soccer too? SWIPE RIGHT! Instant friends. She likes the kind of music that you hate the most? SWIPE LEFT! No chance of a friendship there. On Wink, you can meet new friends in your country and around the world. You can start up  the conversation right on Wink, and add them on Snapchat too.

With the click of a button, you become instantly connected! You go from a swipe on Wink, right to being friends!<br><br>CHAT<br>The fastest and safest way to chat with your new Wink friends is to start up the conversation right here on Wink! You have the option to add them on Snapchat as well, but why not chat a bit first? Get to know your new friends. Find out what you have in common! You can also use the messenger on Wink to send messages, audio messages, photos, ice breakers, GIFs, and even play games against each other. If you\u2019re looking for someone to talk to ASAP, try out Random Chat!

    "descriptionHtml": "Wink: Unlimited friends! Wink is the best place to make new friends from all over the world. It\u2019s as easy as swiping right and starting up a conversation with your potential new bestie.<br><br>So...what exactly do you do on the Wink app?<br><br>SWIPE<br>Swipe right and left through a bunch of new faces! Does that girl love soccer too? SWIPE RIGHT! Instant friends. She likes the kind of music that you hate the most? SWIPE LEFT! No chance of a friendship there. On Wink, you can meet new friends in your country and around the world. You can start up  the conversation right on Wink, and add them on Snapchat too. You\u2019ll see tons of new faces, read about them in their bios, check out their interests, and decide who you really want to be Wink friends or snap friends with! Start swiping to meet your new pals!<br><br>ADD<br>When you request to add someone or they request to add you, Wink makes it super easy to add the new friends you\u2019re meeting to Wink and on Snapchat. With the click of a button, you become instantly connected! You go from a swipe on Wink, right to being friends!<br><br>CHAT<br>The fastest and safest way to chat with your new Wink friends is to start up the conversation right here on Wink! You have the option to add them on Snapchat as well, but why not chat a bit first? Get to know your new friends. Find out what you have in common! You can also use the messenger on Wink to send messages, audio messages, photos, ice breakers, GIFs, and even play games against each other. If you\u2019re looking for someone to talk to ASAP, try out Random Chat! You\u2019ll be instantly connected to someone new, and you\u2019ll have the option to add them as a friend from within the chat if you want to keep talking later! Who knows, someone you start messaging on Wink could become your lifelong best friend! <br><br>EARN<br>You have the opportunity to earn gems every day on Wink! What are the gems used for, you ask? You can use gems to send add requests to your new friends, or to click the back arrow when you may have missed someone. You can also use them in the WinkShop to buy a new background for your profile, or plant a tree in real life. Using your gems to make the world a better place? You\u2019re the best! Whether it\u2019s a daily check-in or sharing Wink with your existing snap friends, there are tons of ways to get more gems. Another way to get gems is to play super fun games in the Wink Arcade. The points you earn from the games will turn into gems! If you keep earning gems, unlimited friends is truly what you\u2019ll find on Wink.<br><br>Basically, what I\u2019m trying to say is... you can never have too many friends. And tbh, it can be hard to make friends sometimes. All the awkwardness and asking for numbers and Snapchats and whatever. Wink exists to help you easily put yourself out there, and find more and more people to make your life even more fun! All you have to do is create your profile, tell everyone who you are, and start to discover your future besties.<br><br>PS - Wink is for friendships ONLY. Thank you.<br><br>Safety disclaimer: Wink is intended to be used for making new friends from all over the world to add and chat with.

    "descriptionHtml": "Wink: Unlimited friends! Wink is the best place to make new friends from all over the world. It\u2019s as easy as swiping right and starting up a conversation with your potential new bestie.<br><br>So...what exactly do you do on the Wink app?<br><br>SWIPE<br>Swipe right and left through a bunch of new faces! Does that girl love soccer too? SWIPE RIGHT! Instant friends. She likes the kind of music that you hate the most? SWIPE LEFT! No chance of a friendship there. On Wink, you can meet new friends in your country and around the world. You can start up  the conversation right on Wink, and add them on Snapchat too. You\u2019ll see tons of new faces, read about them in their bios, check out their interests, and decide who you really want to be Wink friends or snap friends with! Start swiping to meet your new pals!<br><br>ADD<br>When you request to add someone or they request to add you, Wink makes it super easy to add the new friends you\u2019re meeting to Wink and on Snapchat. With the click of a button, you become instantly connected! You go from a swipe on Wink, right to being friends!<br><br>CHAT<br>The fastest and safest way to chat with your new Wink friends is to start up the conversation right here on Wink! You have the option to add them on Snapchat as well, but why not chat a bit first? Get to know your new friends. Find out what you have in common! You can also use the messenger on Wink to send messages, audio messages, photos, ice breakers, GIFs, and even play games against each other. If you\u2019re looking for someone to talk to ASAP, try out Random Chat! You\u2019ll be instantly connected to someone new, and you\u2019ll have the option to add them as a friend from within the chat if you want to keep talking later!

    "descriptionHtml": "Wink: Unlimited friends! Wink is the best place to make new friends from all over the world. It\u2019s as easy as swiping right and starting up a conversation with your potential new bestie.<br><br>So...what exactly do you do on the Wink app?<br><br>SWIPE<br>Swipe right and left through a bunch of new faces! Does that girl love soccer too? SWIPE RIGHT! Instant friends. She likes the kind of music that you hate the most? SWIPE LEFT! No chance of a friendship there. On Wink, you can meet new friends in your country and around the world. You can start up  the conversation right on Wink, and add them on Snapchat too. You\u2019ll see tons of new faces, read about them in their bios, check out their interests, and decide who you really want to be Wink friends or snap friends with! Start swiping to meet your new pals!<br><br>ADD<br>When you request to add someone or they request to add you, Wink makes it super easy to add the new friends you\u2019re meeting to Wink and on Snapchat. With the click of a button, you become instantly connected! You go from a swipe on Wink, right to being friends!<br><br>CHAT<br>The fastest and safest way to chat with your new Wink friends is to start up the conversation right here on Wink! You have the option to add them on Snapchat as well, but why not chat a bit first? Get to know your new friends. Find out what you have in common! You can also use the messenger on Wink to send messages, audio messages, photos, ice breakers, GIFs, and even play games against each other. You\u2019ll be instantly connected to someone new, and you\u2019ll have the option to add them as a friend from within the chat if you want to keep talking later! Who knows, someone you start messaging on Wink could become your lifelong best friend! <br><br>EARN<br>You have the opportunity to earn gems every day on Wink! What are the gems used for, you ask? You can use gems to send add requests to your new friends, or to click the back arrow when you may have missed someone. You can also use them in the WinkShop to buy a new background for your profile, or plant a tree in real life. Using your gems to make the world a better place? You\u2019re the best! Whether it\u2019s a daily check-in or sharing Wink with your existing snap friends, there are tons of ways to get more gems. Another way to get gems is to play super fun games in the Wink Arcade. The points you earn from the games will turn into gems! If you keep earning gems, unlimited friends is truly what you\u2019ll find on Wink.<br><br>Basically, what I\u2019m trying to say is... you can never have too many friends. And tbh, it can be hard to make friends sometimes. All the awkwardness and asking for numbers and Snapchats and whatever. Wink exists to help you easily put yourself out there, and find more and more people to make your life even more fun! All you have to do is create your profile, tell everyone who you are, and start to discover your future besties.<br><br>PS - Wink is for friendships ONLY. Thank you.<br><br>Safety disclaimer: Wink is intended to be used for making new friends from all over the world to add and chat with. Although this communication with new friends doesn\u2019t always happen on our platform, we urge our users to be mindful when considering sharing their location, full name, and all other personal information with new friends. Additionally, Wink is not intended for the buying and selling of adult content. Accounts selling, or requesting inappropriate content will be disabled due to violating our community guidelines.

    "descriptionHtml": "Wink: Unlimited friends! Wink is the best place to make new friends from all over the world. It\u2019s as easy as swiping right and starting up a conversation with your potential new bestie.<br><br>So...what exactly do you do on the Wink app?<br><br>SWIPE<br>Swipe right and left through a bunch of new faces! Does that girl love soccer too? SWIPE RIGHT! Instant friends. She likes the kind of music that you hate the most? SWIPE LEFT! No chance of a friendship there. On Wink, you can meet new friends in your country and around the world. You can start up  the conversation right on Wink, and add them on Snapchat too. You\u2019ll see tons of new faces, read about them in their bios, check out their interests, and decide who you really want to be Wink friends or snap friends with! Start swiping to meet your new pals!<br><br>ADD<br>When you request to add someone or they request to add you, Wink makes it super easy to add the new friends you\u2019re meeting to Wink and on Snapchat. With the click of a button, you become instantly connected! You go from a swipe on Wink, right to being friends!<br><br>CHAT<br>The fastest and safest way to chat with your new Wink friends is to start up the conversation right here on Wink! You have the option to add them on Snapchat as well, but why not chat a bit first? Get to know your new friends. Find out what you have in common! You can also use the messenger on Wink to send messages, audio messages, photos, ice breakers, GIFs, and even play games against each other. You\u2019ll be instantly connected to someone new, and you\u2019ll have the option to add them as a friend from within the chat if you want to keep talking later! Who knows, someone you start messaging on Wink could become your lifelong best friend! <br><br>EARN<br>You have the opportunity to earn gems every day on Wink! What are the gems used for, you ask? You can use gems to send add requests to your new friends, or to click the back arrow when you may have missed someone. You can also use them in the WinkShop to buy a new background for your profile, or plant a tree in real life. Using your gems to make the world a better place? You\u2019re the best! Whether it\u2019s a daily check-in or sharing Wink with your existing snap friends, there are tons of ways to get more gems. Another way to get gems is to play super fun games in the Wink Arcade. The points you earn from the games will turn into gems! If you keep earning gems, unlimited friends is truly what you\u2019ll find on Wink.<br><br>Basically, what I\u2019m trying to say is... you can never have too many friends. And tbh, it can be hard to make friends sometimes. All the awkwardness and asking for numbers and Snapchats and whatever. Wink exists to help you easily put yourself out there, and find more and more people to make your life even more fun! All you have to do is create your profile, tell everyone who you are, and start to discover your future besties.<br><br>PS - Wink is for friendships ONLY. Thank you.<br><br>Safety disclaimer: Wink is intended to be used for making new friends from all over the world to add and chat with.

    "descriptionHtml": "Wink: Unlimited friends! Wink is the best place to make new friends from all over the world. It\u2019s as easy as swiping right and starting up a conversation with your potential new bestie.<br><br>So...what exactly do you do on the Wink app?<br><br>SWIPE<br>Swipe right and left through a bunch of new faces! Does that girl love soccer too? SWIPE RIGHT! Instant friends. She likes the kind of music that you hate the most? SWIPE LEFT! No chance of a friendship there. On Wink, you can meet new friends in your country and around the world. You can start up  the conversation right on Wink, and add them on Snapchat too. You\u2019ll see tons of new faces, read about them in their bios, check out their interests, and decide who you really want to be Wink friends or snap friends with! Start swiping to meet your new pals!<br><br>ADD<br>When you request to add someone or they request to add you, Wink makes it super easy to add the new friends you\u2019re meeting to Wink and on Snapchat. With the click of a button, you become instantly connected! You go from a swipe on Wink, right to being friends!<br><br>CHAT<br>The fastest and safest way to chat with your new Wink friends is to start up the conversation right here on Wink! You have the option to add them on Snapchat as well, but why not chat a bit first? Get to know your new friends. Find out what you have in common! You can also use the messenger on Wink to send messages, audio messages, photos, ice breakers, GIFs, and even play games against each other. You\u2019ll be instantly connected to someone new, and you\u2019ll have the option to add them as a friend from within the chat if you want to keep talking later! Who knows, someone you start messaging on Wink could become your lifelong best friend! <br><br>EARN<br>You have the opportunity to earn gems every day on Wink! What are the gems used for, you ask? You can use gems to send add requests to your new friends, or to click the back arrow when you may have missed someone. You can also use them in the WinkShop to buy a new background for your profile, or plant a tree in real life. Using your gems to make the world a better place? You\u2019re the best! Whether it\u2019s a daily check-in or sharing Wink with your existing snap friends, there are tons of ways to get more gems. Another way to get gems is to play super fun games in the Wink Arcade. The points you earn from the games will turn into gems! If you keep earning gems, unlimited friends is truly what you\u2019ll find on Wink.<br><br>Basically, what I\u2019m trying to say is... you can never have too many friends. And tbh, it can be hard to make friends sometimes. All the awkwardness and asking for numbers and Snapchats and whatever. Wink exists to help you easily put yourself out there, and find more and more people to make your life even more fun! All you have to do is create your profile, tell everyone who you are, and start to discover your future besties.<br><br>PS - Wink is for friendships ONLY.

    "descriptionHtml": "Wink: Unlimited friends! Wink is the best place to make new friends from all over the world. It\u2019s as easy as swiping right and starting up a conversation with your potential new bestie.<br><br>So...what exactly do you do on the Wink app?<br><br>SWIPE<br>Swipe right and left through a bunch of new faces! Does that girl love soccer too? SWIPE RIGHT! Instant friends. She likes the kind of music that you hate the most? SWIPE LEFT! No chance of a friendship there. On Wink, you can meet new friends in your country and around the world. You can start up  the conversation right on Wink, and add them on Snapchat too. You\u2019ll see tons of new faces, read about them in their bios, check out their interests, and decide who you really want to be Wink friends or snap friends with! Start swiping to meet your new pals!<br><br>ADD<br>When you request to add someone or they request to add you, Wink makes it super easy to add the new friends you\u2019re meeting to Wink and on Snapchat. With the click of a button, you become instantly connected! You go from a swipe on Wink, right to being friends!<br><br>CHAT<br>The fastest and safest way to chat with your new Wink friends is to start up the conversation right here on Wink! You have the option to add them on Snapchat as well, but why not chat a bit first? Get to know your new friends. Find out what you have in common! You can also use the messenger on Wink to send messages, audio messages, photos, ice breakers, GIFs, and even play games against each other. You\u2019ll be instantly connected to someone new, and you\u2019ll have the option to add them as a friend from within the chat if you want to keep talking later! Who knows, someone you start messaging on Wink could become your lifelong best friend! <br><br>EARN<br>You have the opportunity to earn gems every day on Wink! What are the gems used for, you ask? You can use gems to send add requests to your new friends, or to click the back arrow when you may have missed someone. You can also use them in the WinkShop to buy a new background for your profile, or plant a tree in real life. Using your gems to make the world a better place? You\u2019re the best! Whether it\u2019s a daily check-in or sharing Wink with your existing snap friends, there are tons of ways to get more gems. Another way to get gems is to play super fun games in the Wink Arcade. The points you earn from the games will turn into gems! If you keep earning gems, unlimited friends is truly what you\u2019ll find on Wink.<br><br>Basically, what I\u2019m trying to say is... you can never have too many friends. And tbh, it can be hard to make friends sometimes. All the awkwardness and asking for numbers and Snapchats and whatever. Wink exists to help you easily put yourself out there, and find more and more people to make your life even more fun! All you have to do is create your profile, tell everyone who you are, and start to discover your future besties.<br><br>PS - Wink is for friendships ONLY. Thank you.<br><br>Safety disclaimer: Wink is intended to be used for making new friends from all over the world to add and chat with.

You have the option to add them on Snapchat as well, but why not chat a bit first? Get to know your new friends. Find out what you have in common! You can also use the messenger on Wink to send messages, audio messages, photos, ice breakers, GIFs, and even play games against each other.

You can use gems to send add requests to your new friends, or to click the back arrow when you may have missed someone. You can also use them in the WinkShop to buy a new background for your profile, or plant a tree in real life. Using your gems to make the world a better place? You\u2019re the best! Whether it\u2019s a daily check-in or sharing Wink with your existing snap friends, there are tons of ways to get more gems. Another way to get gems is to play super fun games in the Wink Arcade.

If you keep earning gems, unlimited friends is truly what you\u2019ll find on Wink.<br><br>Basically, what I\u2019m trying to say is... you can never have too many friends.

It\u2019s as easy as swiping right and starting up a conversation with your potential new bestie.<br><br>So...what exactly do you do on the Wink app?<br><br>SWIPE<br>Swipe right and left through a bunch of new faces!

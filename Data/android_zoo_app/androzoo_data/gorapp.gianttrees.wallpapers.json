    "descriptionHtml": "Giant sequoia species are the largest trees in the world. They grow to an average height of 50-85 m (164-279 ft), with stem diameters ranging from 6-8 m (20-26 ft). The most giant tree ever recorded measured 948 m (3,110 ft) tall. Some studies have also claimed the existence of those with a trunk diameter of 17 m (56 ft). The specimen known to have the largest diameter at chest height is the General Grant Tree at 88 m (288.7 ft). Between 2014 and 2016, Sequoia sempervirens are claimed to have larger trunk diameters than all known giant sequoias, although there are no academic or independent sources confirming or confirming this.<br><br>The oldest known sequoia dates back 3,200-3,266 years, according to dendrochronology. Giant sequoias are also on the list of the longest living organisms in the world. Giant sequoia bark is maybe 90 cm (3 ft) thick at the base of its fibrous, furrowed, and columnar stem. Its sap contains tannic acid, which provides significant protection against fire damage. The leaves are evergreen, 3-6 mm long, and spiral on the shoots.<br><br>Giant sequoia grows from seed. The seed cones are 4-7 cm long and mature in 18-20 months but typically stay green and closed for 20 years. Each cone yields an average of 230 seeds per cone, several seeds per scale, 30-50 per spiral. Seeds are dark brown, 4-5 mm long, and 1 mm wide, with yellow-brown margins 1 mm wide along both sides. While the shrinking of the cones sheds some seeds in hot weather at the end of summer, the majority are shed from damage by insects or drying of the cones from the heat. Young trees usually begin to produce cones after 12 years.<br><br>Some sequoias, such as the Mother of the Forest, are the most giant living trees today.<br><br>\u2022\tSequoia trees are among the tallest trees growing in the world. It is not a common tree species in our country.<br><br>\u2022\tThe sequoia tree is a type of tree that can be over 120 meters tall. The sequoia tree can reach a substantial width with its height and its diameter.<br><br>\u2022\tSequoias can reach a diameter of 7 meters in the light of average data. Sequoia trees are in the class of trees that can produce oxygen for the longest time in the world.<br><br>\u2022\tThe leaves of the sequoia tree remain green throughout the year.<br><br><br>Please choose your desired giant sequoia wallpaper and set it as a lock screen or home screen to give your phone an outstanding appearance.<br><br>We are grateful for your great support and always welcome your feedback about our wallpapers.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Giant sequoia species are the largest trees in the world. They grow to an average height of 50-85 m (164-279 ft), with stem diameters ranging from 6-8 m (20-26 ft). The most giant tree ever recorded measured 948 m (3,110 ft) tall. Some studies have also claimed the existence of those with a trunk diameter of 17 m (56 ft). The specimen known to have the largest diameter at chest height is the General Grant Tree at 88 m (288.7 ft). Between 2014 and 2016, Sequoia sempervirens are claimed to have larger trunk diameters than all known giant sequoias, although there are no academic or independent sources confirming or confirming this.<br><br>The oldest known sequoia dates back 3,200-3,266 years, according to dendrochronology. Giant sequoias are also on the list of the longest living organisms in the world. Giant sequoia bark is maybe 90 cm (3 ft) thick at the base of its fibrous, furrowed, and columnar stem. Its sap contains tannic acid, which provides significant protection against fire damage. The leaves are evergreen, 3-6 mm long, and spiral on the shoots.<br><br>Giant sequoia grows from seed. The seed cones are 4-7 cm long and mature in 18-20 months but typically stay green and closed for 20 years. Each cone yields an average of 230 seeds per cone, several seeds per scale, 30-50 per spiral. Seeds are dark brown, 4-5 mm long, and 1 mm wide, with yellow-brown margins 1 mm wide along both sides. While the shrinking of the cones sheds some seeds in hot weather at the end of summer, the majority are shed from damage by insects or drying of the cones from the heat. Young trees usually begin to produce cones after 12 years.<br><br>Some sequoias, such as the Mother of the Forest, are the most giant living trees today.<br><br>\u2022\tSequoia trees are among the tallest trees growing in the world. It is not a common tree species in our country.<br><br>\u2022\tThe sequoia tree is a type of tree that can be over 120 meters tall. The sequoia tree can reach a substantial width with its height and its diameter.<br><br>\u2022\tSequoias can reach a diameter of 7 meters in the light of average data. Sequoia trees are in the class of trees that can produce oxygen for the longest time in the world.<br><br>\u2022\tThe leaves of the sequoia tree remain green throughout the year.<br><br><br>Please choose your desired giant sequoia wallpaper and set it as a lock screen or home screen to give your phone an outstanding appearance.<br><br>We are grateful for your great support and always welcome your feedback about our wallpapers.",

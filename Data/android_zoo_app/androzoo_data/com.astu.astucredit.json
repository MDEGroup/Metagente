What is the credit score?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A credit score is a measure of consumer\u2019s borrowing power or creditworthiness. The score can be between 300 and 900 depending on your credit history which consists of total debt, types of credit, and repayment history. A credit score of more than 750 ensures higher chances of loan approval and lower interest rates.<br><br>Whenever you apply for a loan or credit card, your payment history, amounts owed, length of credit history, credit mix, and new credit are checked in the credit report along with the credit score.<br><br>There are 4 major credit bureaus in India:<br>1. TransUnion CIBIL<br>2. Experian<br>3. Equifax<br>4. CRIF High Mark<br><br>The credit bureaus have their own algorithm to calculate the credit scores of individuals or businesses. Astu Credit app helps you improve your credit score across all the four credit bureaus.<br><br>2. What are the different credit scoring ranges?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A credit score helps banks, lenders or financial institutions analyse the risk of lending money to you for home, education or personal use. In India, the score ranges from 300 to 900.<br><br>1. Excellent: 750 to 900<br>2. Good: 650 to 749<br>3. Average: 550 to 648<br>4. Bad: Below 549<br><br>3. What is a good credit score in India?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  In India, 900 is the maximum score set by credit bureaus. Any score above 750 is good. To maintain this credit score, it is always necessary to clear your EMIs or monthly instalments and credit card bills on time.<br><br>4. Why is a good credit score important?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A good credit score gives you financial freedom to choose, simplifies your life and helps you save a lot of money. Here are some of the benefits:<br><br>1. Faster loan approvals<br>2. Increases your chances of getting a credit card<br>3. Low-interest rates on loans and credit cards<br>4. More negotiating power<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  Any missed payments on loan, EMI or credit card and high credit utilisation will impact your credit score.<br><br>5.

How often is the credit score updated?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  Generally, it is updated every 30 to 45 days.<br><br>7.

What is the credit score?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A credit score is a measure of consumer\u2019s borrowing power or creditworthiness. The score can be between 300 and 900 depending on your credit history which consists of total debt, types of credit, and repayment history. A credit score of more than 750 ensures higher chances of loan approval and lower interest rates.<br><br>Whenever you apply for a loan or credit card, your payment history, amounts owed, length of credit history, credit mix, and new credit are checked in the credit report along with the credit score.<br><br>There are 4 major credit bureaus in India:<br>1. TransUnion CIBIL<br>2. Experian<br>3. Equifax<br>4. CRIF High Mark<br><br>The credit bureaus have their own algorithm to calculate the credit scores of individuals or businesses. Astu Credit app helps you improve your credit score across all the four credit bureaus.<br><br>2. What are the different credit scoring ranges?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A credit score helps banks, lenders or financial institutions analyse the risk of lending money to you for home, education or personal use. In India, the score ranges from 300 to 900.<br><br>1. Excellent: 750 to 900<br>2. Good: 650 to 749<br>3. Average: 550 to 648<br>4. Bad: Below 549<br><br>3. What is a good credit score in India?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  In India, 900 is the maximum score set by credit bureaus. Any score above 750 is good. To maintain this credit score, it is always necessary to clear your EMIs or monthly instalments and credit card bills on time.<br><br>4. Why is a good credit score important?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A good credit score gives you financial freedom to choose, simplifies your life and helps you save a lot of money. Here are some of the benefits:<br><br>1. Faster loan approvals<br>2. Increases your chances of getting a credit card<br>3. Low-interest rates on loans and credit cards<br>4. More negotiating power<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  Any missed payments on loan, EMI or credit card and high credit utilisation will impact your credit score.<br><br>5. How to improve your credit score?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  The credit score depends on various factors like the number of hard enquiries, account mix, credit utilisation, and payment history. Discipline with your payments over time can help improve your credit score. You can use Astu Credit for increasing your credit score with your monthly rent payments.<br><br>6. How often is the credit score updated?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  Generally, it is updated every 30 to 45 days.<br><br>7. Does a bad credit score affect employment opportunities?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  Some organisations might be interested to know their candidate\u2019s financial health, especially when the role is related to finance and accounting.<br><br>8. How much does it cost to get your credit score?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  Currently, we are giving it for 12 months FREE to our early users. Later, it would be Rs 99 per month to improve the credit score.<br><br>9. Does Astu Credit store personal information?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  No user information is stored.

What is the credit score?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A credit score is a measure of consumer\u2019s borrowing power or creditworthiness. The score can be between 300 and 900 depending on your credit history which consists of total debt, types of credit, and repayment history. A credit score of more than 750 ensures higher chances of loan approval and lower interest rates.<br><br>Whenever you apply for a loan or credit card, your payment history, amounts owed, length of credit history, credit mix, and new credit are checked in the credit report along with the credit score.<br><br>There are 4 major credit bureaus in India:<br>1.

Astu Credit app helps you improve your credit score across all the four credit bureaus.<br><br>2.

What is a good credit score in India?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  In India, 900 is the maximum score set by credit bureaus. Any score above 750 is good. To maintain this credit score, it is always necessary to clear your EMIs or monthly instalments and credit card bills on time.<br><br>4. Why is a good credit score important?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A good credit score gives you financial freedom to choose, simplifies your life and helps you save a lot of money.

What is the credit score?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A credit score is a measure of consumer\u2019s borrowing power or creditworthiness. The score can be between 300 and 900 depending on your credit history which consists of total debt, types of credit, and repayment history. A credit score of more than 750 ensures higher chances of loan approval and lower interest rates.<br><br>Whenever you apply for a loan or credit card, your payment history, amounts owed, length of credit history, credit mix, and new credit are checked in the credit report along with the credit score.<br><br>There are 4 major credit bureaus in India:<br>1. TransUnion CIBIL<br>2. Experian<br>3. Equifax<br>4. CRIF High Mark<br><br>The credit bureaus have their own algorithm to calculate the credit scores of individuals or businesses. Astu Credit app helps you improve your credit score across all the four credit bureaus.<br><br>2. What are the different credit scoring ranges?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A credit score helps banks, lenders or financial institutions analyse the risk of lending money to you for home, education or personal use. In India, the score ranges from 300 to 900.<br><br>1. Excellent: 750 to 900<br>2. Good: 650 to 749<br>3. Average: 550 to 648<br>4. Bad: Below 549<br><br>3. What is a good credit score in India?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  In India, 900 is the maximum score set by credit bureaus. Any score above 750 is good. To maintain this credit score, it is always necessary to clear your EMIs or monthly instalments and credit card bills on time.<br><br>4. Why is a good credit score important?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A good credit score gives you financial freedom to choose, simplifies your life and helps you save a lot of money. Here are some of the benefits:<br><br>1. Faster loan approvals<br>2. Increases your chances of getting a credit card<br>3. Low-interest rates on loans and credit cards<br>4. More negotiating power<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  Any missed payments on loan, EMI or credit card and high credit utilisation will impact your credit score.<br><br>5. How to improve your credit score?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  The credit score depends on various factors like the number of hard enquiries, account mix, credit utilisation, and payment history. Discipline with your payments over time can help improve your credit score. You can use Astu Credit for increasing your credit score with your monthly rent payments.<br><br>6. How often is the credit score updated?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  Generally, it is updated every 30 to 45 days.<br><br>7. Does a bad credit score affect employment opportunities?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  Some organisations might be interested to know their candidate\u2019s financial health, especially when the role is related to finance and accounting.<br><br>8. How much does it cost to get your credit score?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  Currently, we are giving it for 12 months FREE to our early users. Later, it would be Rs 99 per month to improve the credit score.<br><br>9. Does Astu Credit store personal information?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  No user information is stored.

What is a credit score?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A credit score is a measure of consumer\u2019s borrowing power or creditworthiness. The score can be between 300 and 900 depending on your credit history which consists of total debt, types of credit, and repayment history. A credit score of more than 750 in CIBIL ensures higher chances of loan approval and lower interest rates.<br><br>Whenever you apply for a loan or credit card, your payment history, amounts owed, length of credit history, credit mix, and new credit are checked in the credit report along with the credit score.<br><br>There are 4 major credit bureaus in India:<br>1. TransUnion CIBIL (often referred as CIBIL score)<br>2. Experian<br>3. Equifax<br>4. CRIF High Mark<br><br>The credit bureaus have their own algorithm to calculate the credit scores of individuals or businesses. Astu Credit app helps you improve your credit score across all the four credit bureaus.<br><br>2. What are the different credit scoring ranges?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A credit score helps banks, lenders or financial institutions analyse the risk of lending money to you for home, education or personal use. In India, the score ranges from 300 to 900.<br><br>1. Excellent: 750 to 900<br>2. Good: 650 to 749<br>3. Average: 550 to 648<br>4. Bad: Below 549<br><br>3. What is a good credit score in India?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  In India, 900 is the maximum score set by credit bureaus. Any score above 750 in CIBIL is good. To maintain this credit score, it is always necessary to clear your EMIs or monthly instalments and credit card bills on time.<br><br>4. Why is a good credit score important?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A good credit score gives you financial freedom to choose, simplifies your life and helps you save a lot of money. Here are some of the benefits:<br><br>1. Faster loan approvals<br>2. Increases your chances of getting a credit card<br>3. Low-interest rates on loans and credit cards<br>4. More negotiating power<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  Any missed payments on loan, EMI or credit card and high credit utilisation will impact your credit score.<br><br>5. How to improve your credit score?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  The credit score depends on various factors like the number of hard enquiries, account mix, credit utilisation, and payment history. Discipline with your payments over time can help improve your credit score. You can use Astu Debit card to improve your credit score without taking a debt.<br><br>6. How often is the credit score updated?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  Generally, it is updated every 30 to 45 days.<br><br>7.

What is a credit score?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A credit score is a measure of consumer\u2019s borrowing power or creditworthiness. The score can be between 300 and 900 depending on your credit history which consists of total debt, types of credit, and repayment history. A credit score of more than 750 in CIBIL ensures higher chances of loan approval and lower interest rates.<br><br>Whenever you apply for a loan or credit card, your payment history, amounts owed, length of credit history, credit mix, and new credit are checked in the credit report along with the credit score.<br><br>There are 4 major credit bureaus in India:<br>1. TransUnion CIBIL (often referred as CIBIL score)<br>2. Experian<br>3. Equifax<br>4. CRIF High Mark<br><br>The credit bureaus have their own algorithm to calculate the credit scores of individuals or businesses. Astu Credit app helps you improve your credit score across all the four credit bureaus.<br><br>2. What are the different credit scoring ranges?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A credit score helps banks, lenders or financial institutions analyse the risk of lending money to you for home, education or personal use. In India, the score ranges from 300 to 900.<br><br>1. Excellent: 750 to 900<br>2. Good: 650 to 749<br>3. Average: 550 to 648<br>4. Bad: Below 549<br><br>3. What is a good credit score in India?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  In India, 900 is the maximum score set by credit bureaus. Any score above 750 in CIBIL is good. To maintain this credit score, it is always necessary to clear your EMIs or monthly instalments and credit card bills on time.<br><br>4. Why is a good credit score important?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A good credit score gives you financial freedom to choose, simplifies your life and helps you save a lot of money. Here are some of the benefits:<br><br>1. Faster loan approvals<br>2. Increases your chances of getting a credit card<br>3. Low-interest rates on loans and credit cards<br>4. More negotiating power<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  Any missed payments on loan, EMI or credit card and high credit utilisation will impact your credit score.<br><br>5.

What is a credit score?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A credit score is a measure of consumer\u2019s borrowing power or creditworthiness. The score can be between 300 and 900 depending on your credit history which consists of total debt, types of credit, and repayment history. A credit score of more than 750 in CIBIL ensures higher chances of loan approval and lower interest rates.<br><br>Whenever you apply for a loan or credit card, your payment history, amounts owed, length of credit history, credit mix, and new credit are checked in the credit report along with the credit score.<br><br>There are 4 major credit bureaus in India:<br>1. TransUnion CIBIL (often referred as CIBIL score)<br>2. Experian<br>3. Equifax<br>4. CRIF High Mark<br><br>The credit bureaus have their own algorithm to calculate the credit scores of individuals or businesses. Astu Credit app helps you improve your credit score across all the four credit bureaus.<br><br>2. What are the different credit scoring ranges?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A credit score helps banks, lenders or financial institutions analyse the risk of lending money to you for home, education or personal use. In India, the score ranges from 300 to 900.<br><br>1. Excellent: 750 to 900<br>2. Good: 650 to 749<br>3. Average: 550 to 648<br>4. Bad: Below 549<br><br>3. What is a good credit score in India?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  In India, 900 is the maximum score set by credit bureaus. Any score above 750 in CIBIL is good. To maintain this credit score, it is always necessary to clear your EMIs or monthly instalments and credit card bills on time.<br><br>4. Why is a good credit score important?<br><br>\ud83d\udc49  A good credit score gives you financial freedom to choose, simplifies your life and helps you save a lot of money.

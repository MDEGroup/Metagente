    "descriptionHtml": "\u00a0<br>I am a diabetes patient with more that 15 years but in control diet condition without taking any diabetes medicine.<br><br>To control my blood sugar\u00a0level, every morning I took oat, wholemeal bread and low fat calcium milk with steam vegetables as my breakfast. Lunch time, as we are working and normally eat at hawker centre and we really can&#39;t control what food\u00a0 we took. At night time, I will took a small bowl of\u00a0 brown rice. Immediately after the dinner, i will take a walk about half an hours, so that to burn the carbohydrates from the food will consumed.<br><br>My daily routine is without failed, every morning i will check my blood sugar level. If today blood sugar level shoot high a bit said 6.8mmol/L. I will studies back what food I took and review foods that I should take less or avoid it. Not only that, I will extend my walking exercise time from half an hours to a hours so that, the blood sugar stored at liver can be reduced.\u00a0That how, I control my diabetes level with control diet.\u00a0 It is important to do regular medical check-up on HbA1c quarterly, so that you know your sugar level and food consumption to readjust and put extra time for exercise. When my HbA1c\u00a0is high in that quarterly medical report, I will review back my food consumption and extend my exercise time.<br><br>For your information,\u00a0HbA1c\u00a0is a measure of how well controlled your blood sugar has been over a period of about 3 months. It essentially gives a good idea how high or low, on average, your blood glucose levels have been. When my Wheatgrass\u00a0is usually taken as a juice and as such is very high in potassium; therefore it is not a suitable drink for people with\u00a0kidney\u00a0disease. high in that quarterly medical report, I will review back my food consumption and extend my exercise time.<br><br>As a diabetes patient, I also listen advice\u00a0from Gastroenterologist and Hepatologist specialist not simply took the food supplement as Specialist told me before if might let your liver to work harder to\u00a0\u00a0detoxifies chemicals and metabolizes properties.<br><br>I did took the diabetes medicine when I discovered I am diabetes carries type II. I found out my creatinine of kidney is slightly critical than normal person. So, I decided to stop the diabetes medicine and take the control diet and exercise regularly method.<br><br>Creatinine is a chemical waste product produced by muscle metabolism. When your kidneys are functioning normally, they filter creatinine and other waste products out of your blood. These waste products are removed from your\u00a0body\u00a0through urination. A creatinine urine test measures the amount of creatinine in your urine.<br><br>As an ordinary human being, sometimes we did not follow strictly the food consumption and a bit relax and consume a bit more carbohydrates food. That why it is advisable to make a date with your dietitian to taught you how to read the food nutrition, so that you can took the food based on food nutrition.<br><br>I did some survey and found out the  wheatgrass benefit:-<br>\u00a0<br>It&#39;s a superfood.<br>It can eliminate toxins.\u00a0<br>It can help with\u00a0digestion.\u00a0<br>It can boost your metabolism.\u00a0<br>It can lower your\u00a0cholesterol.\u00a0<br>It can boost your\u00a0immune system.\u00a0<br>It can give you energy.\u00a0<br>It can lower your\u00a0blood pressure.<br><br>Take Note **\u00a0Wheatgrass\u00a0\u00a0is very high in potassium; therefore it is not a suitable drink for people with\u00a0kidney\u00a0disease ** .<br><br>I also decided\u00a0 to grow the wheatgrass at home by myself after asked around expert instead of bought ready made consumable wheatgrass sell in marketplace.<br><br>From my successful grow of wheatgrass experienced by myself, I am happy  to share the step by step how to grow wheatgrass easily at home with soil.\u00a0<br><br>Disclaimers<br><br>The above is my personal opinion and experienced I went through. On the medical advice, it might varies from person to person body reaction. The best consult your own doctor for proper advice based on your medical report.\u00a0\u00a0<br><br>Source of original images are obtained at pixabay.com under Free to Use license at https://pixabay.com/service/license/",

    "descriptionHtml": "\u00a0<br>I am a diabetes patient with more that 15 years but in control diet condition without taking any diabetes medicine.<br><br>To control my blood sugar\u00a0level, every morning I took oat, wholemeal bread and low fat calcium milk with steam vegetables as my breakfast. Lunch time, as we are working and normally eat at hawker centre and we really can&#39;t control what food\u00a0 we took. At night time, I will took a small bowl of\u00a0 brown rice. Immediately after the dinner, i will take a walk about half an hours, so that to burn the carbohydrates from the food will consumed.<br><br>My daily routine is without failed, every morning i will check my blood sugar level. If today blood sugar level shoot high a bit said 6.8mmol/L. I will studies back what food I took and review foods that I should take less or avoid it. Not only that, I will extend my walking exercise time from half an hours to a hours so that, the blood sugar stored at liver can be reduced.\u00a0That how, I control my diabetes level with control diet.\u00a0 It is important to do regular medical check-up on HbA1c quarterly, so that you know your sugar level and food consumption to readjust and put extra time for exercise. When my HbA1c\u00a0is high in that quarterly medical report, I will review back my food consumption and extend my exercise time.<br><br>For your information,\u00a0HbA1c\u00a0is a measure of how well controlled your blood sugar has been over a period of about 3 months. It essentially gives a good idea how high or low, on average, your blood glucose levels have been. When my Wheatgrass\u00a0is usually taken as a juice and as such is very high in potassium; therefore it is not a suitable drink for people with\u00a0kidney\u00a0disease. high in that quarterly medical report, I will review back my food consumption and extend my exercise time.<br><br>As a diabetes patient, I also listen advice\u00a0from Gastroenterologist and Hepatologist specialist not simply took the food supplement as Specialist told me before if might let your liver to work harder to\u00a0\u00a0detoxifies chemicals and metabolizes properties.<br><br>I did took the diabetes medicine when I discovered I am diabetes carries type II. I found out my creatinine of kidney is slightly critical than normal person. So, I decided to stop the diabetes medicine and take the control diet and exercise regularly method.<br><br>Creatinine is a chemical waste product produced by muscle metabolism. When your kidneys are functioning normally, they filter creatinine and other waste products out of your blood. These waste products are removed from your\u00a0body\u00a0through urination. A creatinine urine test measures the amount of creatinine in your urine.<br><br>As an ordinary human being, sometimes we did not follow strictly the food consumption and a bit relax and consume a bit more carbohydrates food. That why it is advisable to make a date with your dietitian to taught you how to read the food nutrition, so that you can took the food based on food nutrition.<br><br>I did some survey and found out the  wheatgrass benefit:-<br>\u00a0<br>It&#39;s a superfood.<br>It can eliminate toxins.\u00a0<br>It can help with\u00a0digestion.\u00a0<br>It can boost your metabolism.\u00a0<br>It can lower your\u00a0cholesterol.\u00a0<br>It can boost your\u00a0immune system.\u00a0<br>It can give you energy.\u00a0<br>It can lower your\u00a0blood pressure.<br><br>Take Note **\u00a0Wheatgrass\u00a0\u00a0is very high in potassium; therefore it is not a suitable drink for people with\u00a0kidney\u00a0disease ** .<br><br>I also decided\u00a0 to grow the wheatgrass at home by myself after asked around expert instead of bought ready made consumable wheatgrass sell in marketplace.<br><br>From my successful grow of wheatgrass experienced by myself, I am happy  to share the step by step how to grow wheatgrass easily at home with soil.\u00a0<br><br>Here are the login details to use freely on the Apps:-<br>Email : freetouse@gmail.com<br>Password : freetouse<br><br>Disclaimers<br><br>The above is my personal opinion and experienced I went through.

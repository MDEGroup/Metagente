You chat to different characters, give them advice and make decisions for them, thus determining how the story unfolds!<br><br>We redeveloped the app from scratch to get it into shape for 2020. It\u2019s better looking, more stable, and simply superior. Now it really is a platform deserving of a constantly evolving story.

A devastating pandemic turned the world completely upside down and since then it has been ruled by marauding hordes of zombies.

    "descriptionHtml": "A Void Society is a post-apocalyptic text adventure written in the style of a messenger app. In A Void Society you will experience a gripping end times story, in real time. You chat to different characters, give them advice and make decisions for them, thus determining how the story unfolds!<br><br>We redeveloped the app from scratch to get it into shape for 2020. It\u2019s better looking, more stable, and simply superior. Now it really is a platform deserving of a constantly evolving story. We want to thank all our fans for over 40,000 great ratings and almost 1 million downloads. You made it all possible.<br><br><b>THE BACKSTORY</b><br><br>Nothing is as it was. A devastating pandemic turned the world completely upside down and since then it has been ruled by marauding hordes of zombies. Only David Blythe, allegedly the last survivor of this killer virus, has been hiding away in his apartment, helpless and lonely. He puts his last hope for help in a computer program to try and find other survivors.<br><br>Right now, it seems as though real life has eerily caught up with David\u2019s story. But despite everything that\u2019s going on at the moment, we must always remember that <b>this is just a game!</b><br><br><b>SAVE DAVE!</b><br><br>His supplies are dwindling away to nothing, the solitude is bringing him down and the living dead are getting ever closer. He sends out one last desperate cry for help and all of a sudden, there you are at the other end of the line. From now on, as his constant companion, you accompany him on his adventures from the comfort of your own phone, guiding and supporting him in this action-packed fight for his life against the zombies. In real time, you help David develop elaborate survival strategies to escape the dangers of the apocalypse lurking around every corner and to find other survivors. You even put up with David\u2019s whining whenever he\u2019s close to losing his nerve.<br><br><b>THINK CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU CHOOSE!</b><br><br>Together, you will have to overcome some dicey situations while searching for vital resources like food and mobile phone chargers. But be careful! One false turn could spell the end for our amiable nerd. Every decision you make in this survival text adventure will directly affect David\u2019s chances of survival and shape how the story unfolds.<br><br><b>SOLVE THE PUZZLE!</b><br><br>The deeper you delve into the conundrum surrounding the pandemic, the more mysterious messages you seem to randomly get. These echoes are more than just a reflection of past events. It appears that the origin of the virus isn\u2019t the only riddle in this universe, not even by a long shot. How is it possible for you to communicate with someone through time and space using a simple messenger app? What is the Parallax? And what has this AI called Cathy got to do with all of it?<br><br><b>MEET THE GAMERS!</b><br><br>In our second series, a group of gamers is investigating the same mystery. After a three-day LAN party they realize with horror that the world as they knew it has gone forever. Aside from their concern about what happened to their families and how long their supplies might last, only one important question remains: Will the game finally drop the piece of equipment they\u2019ve been hankering after for their character? <br><br><b>A VOID SOCIETY</b><br>\u25cf Two gripping series<br>\u25cf 18 episodes and counting<br>\u25cf New episodes released regularly<br>\u25cf Several paths through every episode<br>\u25cf A well-thought-out fictional universe<br>\u25cf The perfect storytelling mode for mobile devices<br><br>Go to the developer\u2019s blog for hints &amp; news about the app:<br>https://avoidsociety.app/connect/blog<br><br>Please email the help bot with any questions, queries or feedback you may have:<br>parallax@cloudtells.de",

It\u2019s better looking, more stable, and simply superior. Now it really is a platform deserving of a constantly evolving story.

    "descriptionHtml": "A Void Society is a post-apocalyptic text adventure written in the style of a messenger app. In A Void Society you will experience a gripping end times story, in real time. You chat to different characters, give them advice and make decisions for them, thus determining how the story unfolds!<br><br>We redeveloped the app from scratch to get it into shape for 2020. It\u2019s better looking, more stable, and simply superior. Now it really is a platform deserving of a constantly evolving story. We want to thank all our fans for over 40,000 great ratings and almost 1 million downloads. You made it all possible.<br><br><b>THE BACKSTORY</b><br><br>Nothing is as it was. A devastating pandemic turned the world completely upside down and since then it has been ruled by marauding hordes of zombies. Only David Blythe, allegedly the last survivor of this killer virus, has been hiding away in his apartment, helpless and lonely. He puts his last hope for help in a computer program to try and find other survivors.<br><br>Right now, it seems as though real life has eerily caught up with David\u2019s story. But despite everything that\u2019s going on at the moment, we must always remember that <b>this is just a game!</b><br><br><b>SAVE DAVE!</b><br><br>His supplies are dwindling away to nothing, the solitude is bringing him down and the living dead are getting ever closer. He sends out one last desperate cry for help and all of a sudden, there you are at the other end of the line. From now on, as his constant companion, you accompany him on his adventures from the comfort of your own phone, guiding and supporting him in this action-packed fight for his life against the zombies. In real time, you help David develop elaborate survival strategies to escape the dangers of the apocalypse lurking around every corner and to find other survivors. You even put up with David\u2019s whining whenever he\u2019s close to losing his nerve.<br><br><b>THINK CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU CHOOSE!</b><br><br>Together, you will have to overcome some dicey situations while searching for vital resources like food and mobile phone chargers. But be careful! One false turn could spell the end for our amiable nerd. Every decision you make in this survival text adventure will directly affect David\u2019s chances of survival and shape how the story unfolds.<br><br><b>SOLVE THE PUZZLE!</b><br><br>The deeper you delve into the conundrum surrounding the pandemic, the more mysterious messages you seem to randomly get. These echoes are more than just a reflection of past events. It appears that the origin of the virus isn\u2019t the only riddle in this universe, not even by a long shot. How is it possible for you to communicate with someone through time and space using a simple messenger app? What is the Parallax? And what has this AI called Cathy got to do with all of it?<br><br><b>MEET THE GAMERS!</b><br><br>In our second series, a group of gamers is investigating the same mystery. After a three-day LAN party they realize with horror that the world as they knew it has gone forever. Aside from their concern about what happened to their families and how long their supplies might last, only one important question remains: Will the game finally drop the piece of equipment they\u2019ve been hankering after for their character? <br><br><b>A VOID SOCIETY</b><br>\u25cf Two gripping series<br>\u25cf 18 episodes and counting<br>\u25cf New episodes released regularly<br>\u25cf Several paths through every episode<br>\u25cf A well-thought-out fictional universe<br>\u25cf The perfect storytelling mode for mobile devices<br><br>Go to the developer\u2019s blog for hints &amp; news about the app:<br>https://avoidsociety.app/connect/blog<br><br>Please email the help bot with any questions, queries or feedback you may have:<br>parallax@cloudtells.de",

    "descriptionHtml": "A Void Society is a post-apocalyptic text adventure written in the style of a messenger app. In A Void Society you will experience a gripping end times story, in real time. You chat to different characters, give them advice and make decisions for them, thus determining how the story unfolds!<br><br>We redeveloped the app from scratch to get it into shape for 2020. It\u2019s better looking, more stable, and simply superior. Now it really is a platform deserving of a constantly evolving story. We want to thank all our fans for over 40,000 great ratings and almost 1 million downloads. You made it all possible.<br><br><b>THE BACKSTORY</b><br><br>Nothing is as it was. A devastating pandemic turned the world completely upside down and since then it has been ruled by marauding hordes of zombies. Only David Blythe, allegedly the last survivor of this killer virus, has been hiding away in his apartment, helpless and lonely. He puts his last hope for help in a computer program to try and find other survivors.<br><br>Right now, it seems as though real life has eerily caught up with David\u2019s story. But despite everything that\u2019s going on at the moment, we must always remember that <b>this is just a game!</b><br><br><b>SAVE DAVE!</b><br><br>His supplies are dwindling away to nothing, the solitude is bringing him down and the living dead are getting ever closer. He sends out one last desperate cry for help and all of a sudden, there you are at the other end of the line. From now on, as his constant companion, you accompany him on his adventures from the comfort of your own phone, guiding and supporting him in this action-packed fight for his life against the zombies. In real time, you help David develop elaborate survival strategies to escape the dangers of the apocalypse lurking around every corner and to find other survivors. You even put up with David\u2019s whining whenever he\u2019s close to losing his nerve.<br><br><b>THINK CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU CHOOSE!</b><br><br>Together, you will have to overcome some dicey situations while searching for vital resources like food and mobile phone chargers. But be careful! One false turn could spell the end for our amiable nerd. Every decision you make in this survival text adventure will directly affect David\u2019s chances of survival and shape how the story unfolds.<br><br><b>SOLVE THE PUZZLE!</b><br><br>The deeper you delve into the conundrum surrounding the pandemic, the more mysterious messages you seem to randomly get. These echoes are more than just a reflection of past events. It appears that the origin of the virus isn\u2019t the only riddle in this universe, not even by a long shot. How is it possible for you to communicate with someone through time and space using a simple messenger app? What is the Parallax? And what has this AI called Cathy got to do with all of it?<br><br><b>MEET THE GAMERS!</b><br><br>In our second series, a group of gamers is investigating the same mystery. After a three-day LAN party they realize with horror that the world as they knew it has gone forever. Aside from their concern about what happened to their families and how long their supplies might last, only one important question remains: Will the game finally drop the piece of equipment they\u2019ve been hankering after for their character? <br><br><b>A VOID SOCIETY</b><br>\u25cf Two gripping series<br>\u25cf 18 episodes and counting<br>\u25cf New episodes released regularly<br>\u25cf Several paths through every episode<br>\u25cf A well-thought-out fictional universe<br>\u25cf The perfect storytelling mode for mobile devices<br><br>Go to the developer\u2019s blog for hints &amp; news about the app:<br>https://avoidsociety.app/connect/blog<br><br>Please email the help bot with any questions, queries or feedback you may have:<br>parallax@cloudtells.de",

He puts his last hope for help in a computer program to try and find other survivors.<br><br>Right now, it seems as though real life has eerily caught up with David\u2019s story.

In real time, you help David develop elaborate survival strategies to escape the dangers of the apocalypse lurking around every corner and to find other survivors.

    "descriptionHtml": "A Void Society is a post-apocalyptic text adventure written in the style of a messenger app. In A Void Society you will experience a gripping end times story, in real time. You chat to different characters, give them advice and make decisions for them, thus determining how the story unfolds!<br><br>We redeveloped the app from scratch to get it into shape for 2020. It\u2019s better looking, more stable, and simply superior. Now it really is a platform deserving of a constantly evolving story. We want to thank all our fans for over 40,000 great ratings and almost 1 million downloads. You made it all possible.<br><br><b>THE BACKSTORY</b><br><br>Nothing is as it was. A devastating pandemic turned the world completely upside down and since then it has been ruled by marauding hordes of zombies. Only David Blythe, allegedly the last survivor of this killer virus, has been hiding away in his apartment, helpless and lonely. He puts his last hope for help in a computer program to try and find other survivors.<br><br>Right now, it seems as though real life has eerily caught up with David\u2019s story. But despite everything that\u2019s going on at the moment, we must always remember that <b>this is just a game!</b><br><br><b>SAVE DAVE!</b><br><br>His supplies are dwindling away to nothing, the solitude is bringing him down and the living dead are getting ever closer. He sends out one last desperate cry for help and all of a sudden, there you are at the other end of the line. From now on, as his constant companion, you accompany him on his adventures from the comfort of your own phone, guiding and supporting him in this action-packed fight for his life against the zombies. In real time, you help David develop elaborate survival strategies to escape the dangers of the apocalypse lurking around every corner and to find other survivors. You even put up with David\u2019s whining whenever he\u2019s close to losing his nerve.<br><br><b>THINK CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU CHOOSE!</b><br><br>Together, you will have to overcome some dicey situations while searching for vital resources like food and mobile phone chargers. But be careful! One false turn could spell the end for our amiable nerd. Every decision you make in this survival text adventure will directly affect David\u2019s chances of survival and shape how the story unfolds.<br><br><b>SOLVE THE PUZZLE!</b><br><br>The deeper you delve into the conundrum surrounding the pandemic, the more mysterious messages you seem to randomly get. These echoes are more than just a reflection of past events. It appears that the origin of the virus isn\u2019t the only riddle in this universe, not even by a long shot. How is it possible for you to communicate with someone through time and space using a simple messenger app? What is the Parallax? And what has this AI called Cathy got to do with all of it?<br><br><b>MEET THE GAMERS!</b><br><br>In our second series, a group of gamers is investigating the same mystery. After a three-day LAN party they realize with horror that the world as they knew it has gone forever. Aside from their concern about what happened to their families and how long their supplies might last, only one important question remains: Will the game finally drop the piece of equipment they\u2019ve been hankering after for their character? <br><br><b>A VOID SOCIETY</b><br>\u25cf Two gripping series<br>\u25cf 18 episodes and counting<br>\u25cf New episodes released regularly<br>\u25cf Several paths through every episode<br>\u25cf A well-thought-out fictional universe<br>\u25cf The perfect storytelling mode for mobile devices<br><br>Go to the developer\u2019s blog for hints &amp; news about the app:<br>https://avoidsociety.app/connect/blog<br><br>Please email the help bot with any questions, queries or feedback you may have:<br>parallax@cloudtells.de",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a boat. This means you can actually capsize or sink a boat if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Have fun if learning is not your thing by exploring or competing<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>I try and upload updates every week with something new and interesting added to the sailing simulator.",

In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions.

As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Have fun if learning is not your thing by exploring or competing<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat.

This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>I try and upload updates every week with something new and interesting added to the sailing simulator.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a boat. This means you can actually capsize or sink a boat if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Have fun if learning is not your thing by exploring or competing<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>I try and upload updates every week with something new and interesting added to the sailing simulator.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a boat. This means you can actually capsize or sink a boat if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Have fun if learning is not your thing by exploring or competing<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>I try and upload updates every week with something new and interesting added to the sailing simulator.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a boat. This means you can actually capsize or sink a boat if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Have fun if learning is not your thing by exploring or competing<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>I try and upload updates every week with something new and interesting added to the sailing simulator.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a boat. This means you can actually capsize or sink a boat if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Have fun if learning is not your thing by exploring or competing<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>\u2b55 I try and upload updates every week with something new and interesting added to the sailing simulator. Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go,<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots. If your device doesn&#39;t support the simulator, try using a newer device or look into updating its Operating System.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time. I do try to check everything before i publish a new update but no one is perfect and things do tend to slip my mind from time to time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\ud83d\udca0 Feel free to discuss anything related to the SailSim Simulator in the Community Forum which you can find through the SailSim website or by going directly through the following link: http://www.sailsim.app/forum<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Have fun if learning is not your thing by exploring or competing<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>\u2b55 I try and upload updates every week with something new and interesting added to the sailing simulator. Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go,<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots. If your device doesn&#39;t support the simulator, try using a newer device or look into updating its Operating System.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time. I do try to check everything before i publish a new update but no one is perfect and things do tend to slip my mind from time to time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\ud83d\udca0 Feel free to discuss anything related to the SailSim Simulator in the Community Forum which you can find through the SailSim website or by going directly through the following link: http://www.sailsim.app/forum<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Have fun if learning is not your thing by exploring or competing<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>\u2b55 I try and upload updates every week with something new and interesting added to the sailing simulator. Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go,<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots. If your device doesn&#39;t support the simulator, try using a newer device or look into updating its Operating System.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time. I do try to check everything before i publish a new update but no one is perfect and things do tend to slip my mind from time to time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\u2b55 Please note that the simulator when downloaded is partially locked. You can sail the Laser vessel with all its features. Motoring any other vessel is also possible, however raising sails on any other vessel requires unlocking the simulator as described in the Unlock section.<br><br>\u2503\ud83d\udd34 - Discuss anything related to the SailSim Simulator as well as get downloadable resources made for it through my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/sailingloner<br><br>Follow my adventures through my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@sailingloner<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\u2b55 Please note that the simulator when downloaded is partially locked. You can sail the Laser vessel with all its features. Motoring any other vessel is also possible, however raising sails on any other vessel requires unlocking the simulator as described in the Unlock section.<br><br>\u2503\ud83d\udd34 - Discuss anything related to the SailSim Simulator as well as get downloadable resources made for it through my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/sailingloner<br><br>Follow my adventures through my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@sailingloner<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\u2b55 Please note that the simulator when downloaded is partially locked. You can sail the Laser vessel with all its features. Motoring any other vessel is also possible, however raising sails on any other vessel requires unlocking the simulator as described in the Unlock section.<br><br>\u2503\ud83d\udd34 - Discuss anything related to the SailSim Simulator as well as get downloadable resources made for it through my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/sailingloner<br><br>Follow my adventures through my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@sailingloner<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\u2503\ud83d\udd34 - Discuss anything related to the SailSim Simulator as well as get downloadable resources made for it through my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/sailingloner<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard controls if you have them for complex sailing<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\u2503\ud83d\udd34 - Discuss anything related to the SailSim Simulator as well as get downloadable resources made for it through my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/sailingloner<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard controls if you have them for complex sailing<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\u2503\ud83d\udd34 - Discuss anything related to the SailSim Simulator as well as get downloadable resources made for it through my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/sailingloner<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard controls if you have them for complex sailing<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\u2503\ud83d\udd34 - Discuss anything related to the SailSim Simulator as well as get downloadable resources made for it through my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/sailingloner<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard controls if you have them for complex sailing<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\u2503\ud83d\udd34 - Discuss anything related to the SailSim Simulator as well as get downloadable resources made for it through my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/sailingloner<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard controls if you have them for complex sailing<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\u2503\ud83d\udd34 - Discuss anything related to the SailSim Simulator as well as get downloadable resources made for it through my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/sailingloner<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard controls if you have them for complex sailing<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time.",

In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\u2503\ud83d\udd34 - Discuss anything related to the SailSim Simulator as well as get downloadable resources made for it through my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/sailingloner<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard controls if you have them for complex sailing<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\u2503\ud83d\udd34 - Discuss anything related to the SailSim Simulator as well as get downloadable resources made for it through my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/sailingloner<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard controls if you have them for complex sailing<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time.",

In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\u2503\ud83d\udd34 - Discuss anything related to the SailSim Simulator as well as get downloadable resources made for it through my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/sailingloner<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard controls if you have them for complex sailing<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This sailing simulator applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The simulator was developed by a fellow sailor and a Live-Aboard who loves the sea and everything related to it. As such, many things included in the simulator have been taken from real life experiences.<br><br>\u2503\ud83d\udd34 - Discuss anything related to the SailSim Simulator as well as get downloadable resources made for it through my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/sailingloner<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard controls if you have them for complex sailing<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. <br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to allow those who want to learn sailing or those who already are sailing to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Controller controls for complex sailing<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it by sending me an E-mail and i should have it fixed in no time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to allow those who want to learn sailing or those who already are sailing to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Controller controls for complex sailing<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it by sending me an E-mail and i should have it fixed in no time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to allow those who want to learn sailing or those who already are sailing to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Controller controls for complex sailing<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it by sending me an E-mail and i should have it fixed in no time.",

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to allow those who want to learn sailing or those who already are sailing to have fun and learn something along the way.

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to allow those who want to learn sailing or those who already are sailing to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Game Controller<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it by sending me an E-mail and i should have it fixed in no time.<br><br>\u2b55 Steam Community: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2004650",

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to allow those who want to learn sailing or those who already are sailing to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Game Controller<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it by sending me an E-mail and i should have it fixed in no time.<br><br>\u2b55 Steam Community: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2004650",

The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to allow those who want to learn sailing or those who already are sailing to have fun and learn something along the way.

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to allow those who want to learn sailing or those who already are sailing to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Game Controller<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it by sending me an E-mail and i should have it fixed in no time.<br><br>\u2b55 Steam Community: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2004650",

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to allow those who want to learn sailing or those who already are sailing to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Game Controller<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it by sending me an E-mail and i should have it fixed in no time.<br><br>\u2b55 Steam Community: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2004650",

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to allow those who want to learn sailing or those who already are sailing to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Game Controller<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind.

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to allow those who want to learn sailing or those who already are sailing to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams developed from ASA Textbooks<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Game Controller<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it by sending me an E-mail and i should have it fixed in no time.<br><br>\u2b55 Steam Community: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2004650",

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning, as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The simulator was created to provide sailing knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out marine terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Game Controller<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it by sending me an E-mail and i should have it fixed in no time.<br><br>\u2b55 Steam Community: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2004650",

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning, as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The simulator was created to provide sailing knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out marine terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Game Controller<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it by sending me an E-mail and i should have it fixed in no time.<br><br>\u2b55 Steam Community: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2004650",

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning, as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The simulator was created to provide sailing knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out marine terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Game Controller<br>\ud83d\udd38 Cross - Platform Integration and Scoreboards<br>\ud83d\udd38 Achievements and Leader Boards<br>\ud83d\udd38 Google Play Games Integration<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it by sending me an E-mail and i should have it fixed in no time.<br><br>\u2b55 Steam Community: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2004650",

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning, as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The simulator was created to provide sailing knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Play with others in a Multi-Player session<br>\ud83d\udd38 Collect Stats and share them with others<br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out marine terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Game Controller<br>\ud83d\udd38 Cross - Platform Integration and Scoreboards<br>\ud83d\udd38 Achievements and Leader Boards<br>\ud83d\udd38 Google Play Games Integration<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it by sending me an E-mail and i should have it fixed in no time.<br><br>\u2b55 Steam Community: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2004650",

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning, as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The simulator was created to provide sailing knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Play with others in a Multi-Player session<br>\ud83d\udd38 Collect Stats and share them with others<br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out marine terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Game Controller<br>\ud83d\udd38 Cross - Platform Integration and Scoreboards<br>\ud83d\udd38 Achievements and Leader Boards<br>\ud83d\udd38 Google Play Games Integration<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it by sending me an E-mail and i should have it fixed in no time.<br><br>\u2b55 Steam Community: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2004650",

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning, as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The simulator was created to provide sailing knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Play with others in a Multi-Player session<br>\ud83d\udd38 Collect Stats and share them with others<br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out marine terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Game Controller<br>\ud83d\udd38 Cross - Platform Integration and Scoreboards<br>\ud83d\udd38 Achievements and Leader Boards<br>\ud83d\udd38 Google Play Games Integration<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it by sending me an E-mail and i should have it fixed in no time.<br><br>\u2b55 Steam Community: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2004650",

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning, as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The simulator was created to provide sailing knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Play with others in a Multi-Player session<br>\ud83d\udd38 Collect Stats and share them with others<br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out marine terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Game Controller<br>\ud83d\udd38 Cross - Platform Integration and Scoreboards<br>\ud83d\udd38 Achievements and Leader Boards<br>\ud83d\udd38 Google Play Games Integration<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 30 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it by sending me an E-mail and i should have it fixed in no time.<br><br>\u2b55 Steam Community: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2004650",

    "descriptionHtml": "As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning, as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The simulator was created to provide sailing knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. The main goal is to have fun and learn something along the way. Hopefully that goal is being achieved with every update i make to the simulator.<br><br>\ud83d\udd38 Play with others in a Multi-Player session<br>\ud83d\udd38 Collect Stats and share them with others<br>\ud83d\udd38 Test your self through Exams<br>\ud83d\udd38 Try out different sailing vessels<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn different parts of a sailboat<br>\ud83d\udd38 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses<br>\ud83d\udd38 Check out marine terminology and sailing equipment<br>\ud83d\udd38 Explore Adventures and Solve Challenges<br>\ud83d\udd38 Use Keyboard or Game Controller<br>\ud83d\udd38 Cross - Platform Integration and Scoreboards<br>\ud83d\udd38 Achievements and Leader Boards<br>\ud83d\udd38 Google Play Games Integration<br><br>\u26ab  Currently available vessels are<br>\u25fc Laser - Olympic<br>\u25fc Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel)<br>\u25fc Sabre Spirit 37 (Fin Keel)<br><br>\u26ab  Current Sailing Features<br>\u25fc Keel Control<br>\u25fc Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect<br>\u25fc Boom Direction <br>\u25fc Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces<br>\u25fc Boom Vang Control<br>\u25fc Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding<br>\u25fc Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control<br>\u25fc Spinnaker Control<br>\u25fc Sail Reefing<br>\u25fc Rudder vs Velocity control<br>\u25fc Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass<br>\u25fc Rudder reverse control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine control<br>\u25fc Outboard engine prop walk effect<br>\u25fc Sail Drive Prop Walk effect<br>\u25fc Dynamic Wind<br>\u25fc Drift effect vs Sail direction<br>\u25fc Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects<br>\u25fc Jib and Main Sail &quot;Rudder Pull&quot; when used separately<br>\u25fc Dynamics based on the environment<br>\u25fc Much more...<br><br>SailSim applies actual physics to simulate the behavior of a sailing vessel. This means you can actually capsize or sink a vessel if you are not careful.  In some cases the sailing simulator can even reproduce unpredictable results based on your actions, selected parameters and conditions. The visuals are meant not to be too serious where it doesn&#39;t matter as much (Environment in specific) but playful and fun. <br><br>I spend a great deal of time on the physics of the simulator where a vessel can receive up to 40 or more forces dynamically at the same time, so the vessels are not just bumbling around but are actually getting the forces you would get in real life (mostly since nothing is perfect).<br><br>Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with physics when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br><br>Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br><br>I am having a blast developing this as an ongoing project. Spend lots of sleepless nights just because the specific environment or function is just too fun to stop making. Hopefully others will appreciate the work that is made by just one man on a small boat at sea :)<br><br>\u2b55 Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br><br>\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work properly. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots.<br><br>\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don&#39;t hesitate to mention it by sending me an E-mail and i should have it fixed in no time.<br><br>\u2b55 Steam Community: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2004650",

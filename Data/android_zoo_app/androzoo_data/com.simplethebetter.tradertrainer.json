Very beginner? Want to learn something first before practice?  No problem, basic chart reading training/Candlestick pattern training is provided in learning center. The basic chart training is straightforward. It points out why non-pro unable to make money consistently and points out the right direction as well.<br><br>The simulator is the best you can find on market. Long/short/market order/limit order/stocks/futures. You can view charts in different barsizes. You can even review all the trades you made in charts. How cool is that! You can also write down your trading thoughts/journal/diary in this app. You have nowhere else to find this kind of app.<br><br>Simply launch this app and practice when you are on the go or in the middle of boring meeting. To be serious, you need several thousand trades before you can understand what the trend is. And even more trades to find out good timing for entry and exit.<br><br>This app is designed and developed by a real professional trader. You will tell the differences once you start using it.<br><br>Application will randomly pick one session from <br>1. US stocks JPM, GOOG, AMZN, AAPL, SPY, and TSLA 1minute<br>2.

You will never have to be jealous of someone else any more. <br><br>Why 1 minute/5 minute/15 minute bar trading? My answer is there are not many differences between N-minute bar trading and day bar trading. The nature of price movement and action are same. <br><br>Why future trading? Again, not many differences. The only major difference is future has very high leverage 10 times or even more vs normal stocks.

    "descriptionHtml": "This professional trader training app is an Equity Trader self training, self practicing application. It is designed for traders to improve trading skills without going to attend useless and expensive learning courses or losing real money and time to gain your trading skills.<br><br>This app is designed for experienced users who wants to make a living from trading. Very beginner? Want to learn something first before practice?  No problem, basic chart reading training/Candlestick pattern training is provided in learning center. The basic chart training is straightforward. It points out why non-pro unable to make money consistently and points out the right direction as well.<br><br>The simulator is the best you can find on market. Long/short/market order/limit order/stocks/futures. You can view charts in different barsizes. You can even review all the trades you made in charts. How cool is that! You can also write down your trading thoughts/journal/diary in this app. You have nowhere else to find this kind of app.<br><br>Simply launch this app and practice when you are on the go or in the middle of boring meeting. To be serious, you need several thousand trades before you can understand what the trend is. And even more trades to find out good timing for entry and exit.<br><br>This app is designed and developed by a real professional trader. You will tell the differences once you start using it.<br><br>Application will randomly pick one session from <br>1. US stocks JPM, GOOG, AMZN, AAPL, SPY, and TSLA 1minute<br>2. US futures Emini ES, European Dollar EUR, US oil CL and US Gold GC 1minute<br>3. 5 minute Forex<br>4. 5 minute Emini<br>5. 15 minute Forex<br>6. 15 minute US stock TSLA <br>once you launch a new session. Start your self training today. Spend 1-2 hours a day. If you are an independent thinker you should be able to become a successful trader after 6-months -2 years practice. You will never have to be jealous of someone else any more. <br><br>Why 1 minute/5 minute/15 minute bar trading? My answer is there are not many differences between N-minute bar trading and day bar trading. The nature of price movement and action are same. <br><br>Why future trading? Again, not many differences. The only major difference is future has very high leverage 10 times or even more vs normal stocks. You need a stop order for sure.<br><br>Keep practicing till you can consistently make a decent profit on daily basis. By default, commission  is 1$ for 200 shares and 5$ for 1 future contract one way trade. You can set also adjust leverage in settings because default leverage is very high.<br><br>You will find you are unable to consistently make money easily with this app. If you say you can easily make big virtual money using other apps then I would suggest you uninstall those immediately and try ours because In real world, for sure it is hard to make money and you are wasting your time.<br><br>To be honest, portfolio/position/risk management is not that important compared with a winning strategy. Don&#39;t expect a couple of trades with big profits. In stead, you need at least 60% winning trades to survive.<br><br>Don&#39;t hesitate. Try today and let me and everyone else know how you feel about this app.<br><br>As of Nov 10, 2018, we have added US stock market quotes and charts for active/professional traders. If you need an app to go over 400+ major stocks and find the candidates for your next day trading then this feature(Pocket Exchange) is designed for you.<br><br>Keywords: Stock training, trader training, day trader, trader trainer,stock trainer, stock simulator, virtual trading,day trader training, Forex, Forex Trading, US stocks, Forex Training",

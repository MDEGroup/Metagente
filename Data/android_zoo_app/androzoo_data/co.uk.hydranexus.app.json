    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

    "descriptionHtml": "NEXUS Cloud \u2013 Launch, optimise and scale your EV charging network <br>Hydra has designed, built, and deployed our OCPP charge point management platform NEXUS Cloud to control and monitor each charge point across our entire network. NEXUS cloud has been designed to offer scalability to all users regardless if you are an SME, charge point operator,  global enterprise, or fleet operator we have a package to suit your needs with room to grow. <br>NEXUS cloud has been constructed to the highest OCPP standards and is agnostic with all compatible OCPP ChargePoint hardware. <br>We have invested in an industry-leading platform that is designed for large-scale deployment of charge points across both national and international regions. NEXUS Cloud comprises features that allow it to be commissioned and used by any client within most types of charging infrastructure use cases. <br>We have identified the three following sectors that are critical to ensure product reliability and continued innovation. <br><br>Up Time <br>This is instrumental and a primary requirement for both the hardware and software, using  OCPP error codes and a comprehensive automated error code system within our ChargePoints we are able to determine where the fault originated from either hardware or software, time-stamped fault identification, and the fault remedy in real-time, remotely. <br><br>Our Charge points are also maintained via a \u2018preventative planned maintenance\u2019 period every 12 months when the Charge point should be visually checked. This system decreases unwanted emergency maintenance periods and maintains the charge point\u2019s integrity over its operational life. <br><br>The remote aspect of this comprehensive system is vital to minimise both unnecessary site visits and real-time support to both the Charge point operator and the EV user. <br><br>Optimal Revenue Generation <br>One of the main features that NEXUS Cloud supports in order to increase revenue generation is both contactless and virtual payment methods.<br>-Collect revenue <br>-Track costs <br>-Offer subscription-based plans <br>-Flexible payments <br>-Direct payment settlements <br>-Automatic billing <br>-Automated and detailed financial reporting <br>-Tariff-driven charging <br><br>Real Time Management <br>NEXUS Cloud offers an abundance of features in order to maintain and operate each individual charge point in real-time. Individual charge points or \u2018Groups\u2019 can be remotely accessed and commanded based on the real-time data from the charge point operator. This means that fluctuations in energy prices, connector fees, or priority charging sessions can all be managed through NEXUS cloud at any time. The advantages of our cloud-based system allow your charging network to be remotely accessed from anywhere in the world at any time, all supported by Hydra EVC and our 24-hour assistance ticketing system. <br><br>Using industry-standard OCPP profiles NEXUS can extract and analyse real-time data from each charge point in order to offer detailed analytics to the NEXUS Cloud dashboard. <br><br>More extensive features of NEXUS Cloud are, <br>- Hardware agnostic integration for continued growth with OCPP-compliant brands<br>- Remote management for improved and maintained infrastructure efficiency <br>- Bespoke pricing plans and tariffs covering multiple business models and use cases <br>- Comprehensive customisable reporting and real-time analytics <br>- Intelligent Dynamic Load Balancing for optimal power distribution <br>- EV Roaming expanding the network reach across multiple compliant platforms <br>- Customisable notifications for data thresholds <br>- Access controls to manage user access and privileges <br>- Automatic over-the-air software and firmware updates <br>- Tracking costs such as energy prices, hardware investment, and profitability",

With over 24+ years experience in the nutrition field, expert holistic nutritionist Derek Johnson\u2019s DJN mobile app is your ultimate resource to make your wellness journey simple, realistic and maintainable!  <br><br>Designed with your personalized success in mind, the DJN app makes following a health and wellness plan easy! Once you select one (ex: paleo, keto, etc), you\u2019ll gain access to the info, recipes, meal plans, shopping lists, daily summaries and recommended supplements to achieve your goals. Following your plan and logging your progress is simple. From the Tracking Dashboard you\u2019ll have easy access to the different aspects of your specific plan: <br><br>Body \u2013 How are you sleeping? Have you lost weight? What is your heart rate? Your app is pre-configured so that you can track what factors are important to your individual wellness program by syncing with most wearable devices. <br><br>Nutrition \u2013 What are you eating? Take a photo of your food, type in a note, log the plan items you&#39;re consuming (and even the off-plan items too). The more you see the reality of your food choices, the easier it will be to make modifications. <br><br>Meditation \u2013 If mindfulness or meditation is part of your wellness program, you can record time spent meditating. <br><br>Condition \u2013 How are you feeling? Are you tired? Depressed? Feeling bloated after meals? Craving sugar? Tracking daily symptoms allows for correlating how you feel to what you are doing for movement, supplements and especially, nutrition.<br><br>Movement \u2013 Are you moving? Walking? Stretching? Doing yoga? Track it! Are you wearing a Fitbit, Apple Watch or another wearable? You can automatically upload/sync your data into the DJN app. <br><br>Journal \u2013 People who journal or track what they do are more successful at following a plan. In this app, you can record all the details of what you\u2019re eating and drinking (just use the Home or microphone button on your phone and you can even dictate your entries). <br><br>\u2022 Optional exclusive access to customized nutrition plans tailored for your goals<br><br>\u2022 Food &amp; Movement Log - syncs with most wearable devices <br><br>\u2022 Intermittent fasting timer for your meal plans <br><br>\u2022 Features over 20 different meal plans to choose from including paleo, keto, vegan and more\u2026<br><br>\u2022 Optional Group and Cleanse Programs if you want to be part of group support and community<br><br>\u2022 100s of recipes<br><br>\u2022 Option to customize and upgrade to 1:1 coaching, nutrition sessions<br><br>\u2022 And so much more!<br><br><br>DJN also allows you to track your progress in key areas (see list below) that other apps don\u2019t include. To truly live a healthier lifestyle is not solely focused on your weight or what\u2019s on your plate \u2013 it\u2019s also how you feel, sleep, your energy, digestion and so on.  This app also uniquely offers the option to have nutritionist Derek Johnson follow along in your progress and make recommendations along the way (additional). Just imagine, the more you track what you\u2019re eating and doing, the easier it is for Derek to understand how your selected plan is working for you, where it needs to be adjusted and how best to support you in your journey. Staying on track is easy for some, but if you need custom personal guidance and support directly from him, that\u2019s an option too! <br><br>Get ready to charge of your health, change your relationship with food and not only reach your goals - but maintain your results once and for all!<br><br>Let\u2019s do this!",

With over 24+ years experience in the nutrition field, expert holistic nutritionist Derek Johnson\u2019s DJN mobile app is your ultimate resource to make your wellness journey simple, realistic and maintainable!  <br><br>Designed with your personalized success in mind, the DJN app makes following a health and wellness plan easy! Once you select one (ex: paleo, keto, etc), you\u2019ll gain access to the info, recipes, meal plans, shopping lists, daily summaries and recommended supplements to achieve your goals. Following your plan and logging your progress is simple. From the Tracking Dashboard you\u2019ll have easy access to the different aspects of your specific plan: <br><br>Body \u2013 How are you sleeping? Have you lost weight? What is your heart rate? Your app is pre-configured so that you can track what factors are important to your individual wellness program by syncing with most wearable devices. <br><br>Nutrition \u2013 What are you eating? Take a photo of your food, type in a note, log the plan items you&#39;re consuming (and even the off-plan items too). The more you see the reality of your food choices, the easier it will be to make modifications. <br><br>Meditation \u2013 If mindfulness or meditation is part of your wellness program, you can record time spent meditating. <br><br>Condition \u2013 How are you feeling? Are you tired? Depressed? Feeling bloated after meals? Craving sugar? Tracking daily symptoms allows for correlating how you feel to what you are doing for movement, supplements and especially, nutrition.<br><br>Movement \u2013 Are you moving? Walking? Stretching? Doing yoga? Track it! Are you wearing a Fitbit, Apple Watch or another wearable? You can automatically upload/sync your data into the DJN app. <br><br>Journal \u2013 People who journal or track what they do are more successful at following a plan. In this app, you can record all the details of what you\u2019re eating and drinking (just use the Home or microphone button on your phone and you can even dictate your entries). <br><br>\u2022 Optional exclusive access to customized nutrition plans tailored for your goals<br><br>\u2022 Food &amp; Movement Log - syncs with most wearable devices <br><br>\u2022 Intermittent fasting timer for your meal plans <br><br>\u2022 Features over 20 different meal plans to choose from including paleo, keto, vegan and more\u2026<br><br>\u2022 Optional Group and Cleanse Programs if you want to be part of group support and community<br><br>\u2022 100s of recipes<br><br>\u2022 Option to customize and upgrade to 1:1 coaching, nutrition sessions<br><br>\u2022 And so much more!<br><br><br>DJN also allows you to track your progress in key areas (see list below) that other apps don\u2019t include. To truly live a healthier lifestyle is not solely focused on your weight or what\u2019s on your plate \u2013 it\u2019s also how you feel, sleep, your energy, digestion and so on.  This app also uniquely offers the option to have nutritionist Derek Johnson follow along in your progress and make recommendations along the way (additional). Just imagine, the more you track what you\u2019re eating and doing, the easier it is for Derek to understand how your selected plan is working for you, where it needs to be adjusted and how best to support you in your journey. Staying on track is easy for some, but if you need custom personal guidance and support directly from him, that\u2019s an option too! <br><br>Get ready to charge of your health, change your relationship with food and not only reach your goals - but maintain your results once and for all!<br><br>Let\u2019s do this!",

With over 24+ years experience in the nutrition field, expert holistic nutritionist Derek Johnson\u2019s DJN mobile app is your ultimate resource to make your wellness journey simple, realistic and maintainable!  <br><br>Designed with your personalized success in mind, the DJN app makes following a health and wellness plan easy! Once you select one (ex: paleo, keto, etc), you\u2019ll gain access to the info, recipes, meal plans, shopping lists, daily summaries and recommended supplements to achieve your goals. Following your plan and logging your progress is simple. From the Tracking Dashboard you\u2019ll have easy access to the different aspects of your specific plan: <br><br>Body \u2013 How are you sleeping? Have you lost weight? What is your heart rate? Your app is pre-configured so that you can track what factors are important to your individual wellness program by syncing with most wearable devices. <br><br>Nutrition \u2013 What are you eating? Take a photo of your food, type in a note, log the plan items you&#39;re consuming (and even the off-plan items too). The more you see the reality of your food choices, the easier it will be to make modifications. <br><br>Meditation \u2013 If mindfulness or meditation is part of your wellness program, you can record time spent meditating. <br><br>Condition \u2013 How are you feeling? Are you tired? Depressed? Feeling bloated after meals? Craving sugar? Tracking daily symptoms allows for correlating how you feel to what you are doing for movement, supplements and especially, nutrition.<br><br>Movement \u2013 Are you moving? Walking? Stretching? Doing yoga? Track it! Are you wearing a Fitbit, Apple Watch or another wearable? You can automatically upload/sync your data into the DJN app. <br><br>Journal \u2013 People who journal or track what they do are more successful at following a plan. In this app, you can record all the details of what you\u2019re eating and drinking (just use the Home or microphone button on your phone and you can even dictate your entries). <br><br>\u2022 Optional exclusive access to customized nutrition plans tailored for your goals<br><br>\u2022 Food &amp; Movement Log - syncs with most wearable devices <br><br>\u2022 Intermittent fasting timer for your meal plans <br><br>\u2022 Features over 20 different meal plans to choose from including paleo, keto, vegan and more\u2026<br><br>\u2022 Optional Group and Cleanse Programs if you want to be part of group support and community<br><br>\u2022 100s of recipes<br><br>\u2022 Option to customize and upgrade to 1:1 coaching, nutrition sessions<br><br>\u2022 And so much more!<br><br><br>DJN also allows you to track your progress in key areas (see list below) that other apps don\u2019t include. To truly live a healthier lifestyle is not solely focused on your weight or what\u2019s on your plate \u2013 it\u2019s also how you feel, sleep, your energy, digestion and so on.  This app also uniquely offers the option to have nutritionist Derek Johnson follow along in your progress and make recommendations along the way (additional). Just imagine, the more you track what you\u2019re eating and doing, the easier it is for Derek to understand how your selected plan is working for you, where it needs to be adjusted and how best to support you in your journey. Staying on track is easy for some, but if you need custom personal guidance and support directly from him, that\u2019s an option too! <br><br>Get ready to charge of your health, change your relationship with food and not only reach your goals - but maintain your results once and for all!<br><br>Let\u2019s do this!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Ready to commit to a healthier lifestyle but are unsure of where to start, what to eat or even how to maintain any results? With over 24+ years experience in the nutrition field, expert holistic nutritionist Derek Johnson\u2019s DJN mobile app is your ultimate resource to make your wellness journey simple, realistic and maintainable!  <br><br>Designed with your personalized success in mind, the DJN app makes following a health and wellness plan easy! Once you select one (ex: paleo, keto, etc), you\u2019ll gain access to the info, recipes, meal plans, shopping lists, daily summaries and recommended supplements to achieve your goals. Following your plan and logging your progress is simple. From the Tracking Dashboard you\u2019ll have easy access to the different aspects of your specific plan: <br><br>Body \u2013 How are you sleeping? Have you lost weight? What is your heart rate? Your app is pre-configured so that you can track what factors are important to your individual wellness program by syncing with most wearable devices. <br><br>Nutrition \u2013 What are you eating? Take a photo of your food, type in a note, log the plan items you&#39;re consuming (and even the off-plan items too). The more you see the reality of your food choices, the easier it will be to make modifications. <br><br>Meditation \u2013 If mindfulness or meditation is part of your wellness program, you can record time spent meditating. <br><br>Condition \u2013 How are you feeling? Are you tired? Depressed? Feeling bloated after meals? Craving sugar? Tracking daily symptoms allows for correlating how you feel to what you are doing for movement, supplements and especially, nutrition.<br><br>Movement \u2013 Are you moving? Walking? Stretching? Doing yoga? Track it! Are you wearing a Fitbit, Apple Watch or another wearable? You can automatically upload/sync your data into the DJN app. <br><br>Journal \u2013 People who journal or track what they do are more successful at following a plan. In this app, you can record all the details of what you\u2019re eating and drinking (just use the Home or microphone button on your phone and you can even dictate your entries). <br><br>\u2022 Optional exclusive access to customized nutrition plans tailored for your goals<br><br>\u2022 Food &amp; Movement Log - syncs with most wearable devices <br><br>\u2022 Intermittent fasting timer for your meal plans <br><br>\u2022 Features over 20 different meal plans to choose from including paleo, keto, vegan and more\u2026<br><br>\u2022 Optional Group and Cleanse Programs if you want to be part of group support and community<br><br>\u2022 100s of recipes<br><br>\u2022 Option to customize and upgrade to 1:1 coaching, nutrition sessions<br><br>\u2022 And so much more!<br><br><br>DJN also allows you to track your progress in key areas (see list below) that other apps don\u2019t include. To truly live a healthier lifestyle is not solely focused on your weight or what\u2019s on your plate \u2013 it\u2019s also how you feel, sleep, your energy, digestion and so on.  This app also uniquely offers the option to have nutritionist Derek Johnson follow along in your progress and make recommendations along the way (additional). Just imagine, the more you track what you\u2019re eating and doing, the easier it is for Derek to understand how your selected plan is working for you, where it needs to be adjusted and how best to support you in your journey. Staying on track is easy for some, but if you need custom personal guidance and support directly from him, that\u2019s an option too! <br><br>Get ready to charge of your health, change your relationship with food and not only reach your goals - but maintain your results once and for all!<br><br>Let\u2019s do this!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Ready to commit to a healthier lifestyle but are unsure of where to start, what to eat or even how to maintain any results? With over 24+ years experience in the nutrition field, expert holistic nutritionist Derek Johnson\u2019s DJN mobile app is your ultimate resource to make your wellness journey simple, realistic and maintainable!  <br><br>Designed with your personalized success in mind, the DJN app makes following a health and wellness plan easy! Once you select one (ex: paleo, keto, etc), you\u2019ll gain access to the info, recipes, meal plans, shopping lists, daily summaries and recommended supplements to achieve your goals. Following your plan and logging your progress is simple. From the Tracking Dashboard you\u2019ll have easy access to the different aspects of your specific plan: <br><br>Body \u2013 How are you sleeping? Have you lost weight? What is your heart rate? Your app is pre-configured so that you can track what factors are important to your individual wellness program by syncing with most wearable devices. <br><br>Nutrition \u2013 What are you eating? Take a photo of your food, type in a note, log the plan items you&#39;re consuming (and even the off-plan items too). The more you see the reality of your food choices, the easier it will be to make modifications. <br><br>Meditation \u2013 If mindfulness or meditation is part of your wellness program, you can record time spent meditating. <br><br>Condition \u2013 How are you feeling? Are you tired? Depressed? Feeling bloated after meals? Craving sugar? Tracking daily symptoms allows for correlating how you feel to what you are doing for movement, supplements and especially, nutrition.<br><br>Movement \u2013 Are you moving? Walking? Stretching? Doing yoga? Track it! Are you wearing a Fitbit, Apple Watch or another wearable? You can automatically upload/sync your data into the DJN app. <br><br>Journal \u2013 People who journal or track what they do are more successful at following a plan. In this app, you can record all the details of what you\u2019re eating and drinking (just use the Home or microphone button on your phone and you can even dictate your entries). <br><br>\u2022 Optional exclusive access to customized nutrition plans tailored for your goals<br><br>\u2022 Food &amp; Movement Log - syncs with most wearable devices <br><br>\u2022 Intermittent fasting timer for your meal plans <br><br>\u2022 Features over 20 different meal plans to choose from including paleo, keto, vegan and more\u2026<br><br>\u2022 Optional Group and Cleanse Programs if you want to be part of group support and community<br><br>\u2022 100s of recipes<br><br>\u2022 Option to customize and upgrade to 1:1 coaching, nutrition sessions<br><br>\u2022 And so much more!<br><br><br>DJN also allows you to track your progress in key areas (see list below) that other apps don\u2019t include. To truly live a healthier lifestyle is not solely focused on your weight or what\u2019s on your plate \u2013 it\u2019s also how you feel, sleep, your energy, digestion and so on.  This app also uniquely offers the option to have nutritionist Derek Johnson follow along in your progress and make recommendations along the way (additional). Just imagine, the more you track what you\u2019re eating and doing, the easier it is for Derek to understand how your selected plan is working for you, where it needs to be adjusted and how best to support you in your journey. Staying on track is easy for some, but if you need custom personal guidance and support directly from him, that\u2019s an option too! <br><br>Get ready to charge of your health, change your relationship with food and not only reach your goals - but maintain your results once and for all!<br><br>Let\u2019s do this!",

Once you select one (ex: paleo, keto, etc), you\u2019ll gain access to the info, recipes, meal plans, shopping lists, daily summaries and recommended supplements to achieve your goals. Following your plan and logging your progress is simple. From the Tracking Dashboard you\u2019ll have easy access to the different aspects of your specific plan: <br><br>Body \u2013 How are you sleeping? Have you lost weight? What is your heart rate? Your app is pre-configured so that you can track what factors are important to your individual wellness program by syncing with most wearable devices. <br><br>Nutrition \u2013 What are you eating? Take a photo of your food, type in a note, log the plan items you&#39;re consuming (and even the off-plan items too). The more you see the reality of your food choices, the easier it will be to make modifications. <br><br>Meditation \u2013 If mindfulness or meditation is part of your wellness program, you can record time spent meditating. <br><br>Condition \u2013 How are you feeling? Are you tired? Depressed? Feeling bloated after meals? Craving sugar? Tracking daily symptoms allows for correlating how you feel to what you are doing for movement, supplements and especially, nutrition.<br><br>Movement \u2013 Are you moving? Walking? Stretching? Doing yoga? Track it! Are you wearing a Fitbit, Apple Watch or another wearable? You can automatically upload/sync your data into the DJN app. <br><br>Journal \u2013 People who journal or track what they do are more successful at following a plan.

With over 24+ years experience in the nutrition field, expert holistic nutritionist Derek Johnson\u2019s DJN mobile app is your ultimate resource to make your wellness journey simple, realistic and maintainable!  <br><br>Designed with your personalized success in mind, the DJN app makes following a health and wellness plan easy! Once you select one (ex: paleo, keto, etc), you\u2019ll gain access to the info, recipes, meal plans, shopping lists, daily summaries and recommended supplements to achieve your goals. Following your plan and logging your progress is simple. From the Tracking Dashboard you\u2019ll have easy access to the different aspects of your specific plan: <br><br>Body \u2013 How are you sleeping? Have you lost weight? What is your heart rate? Your app is pre-configured so that you can track what factors are important to your individual wellness program by syncing with most wearable devices. <br><br>Nutrition \u2013 What are you eating? Take a photo of your food, type in a note, log the plan items you&#39;re consuming (and even the off-plan items too). The more you see the reality of your food choices, the easier it will be to make modifications. <br><br>Meditation \u2013 If mindfulness or meditation is part of your wellness program, you can record time spent meditating. <br><br>Condition \u2013 How are you feeling? Are you tired? Depressed? Feeling bloated after meals? Craving sugar? Tracking daily symptoms allows for correlating how you feel to what you are doing for movement, supplements and especially, nutrition.<br><br>Movement \u2013 Are you moving? Walking? Stretching? Doing yoga? Track it! Are you wearing a Fitbit, Apple Watch or another wearable? You can automatically upload/sync your data into the DJN app. <br><br>Journal \u2013 People who journal or track what they do are more successful at following a plan. In this app, you can record all the details of what you\u2019re eating and drinking (just use the Home or microphone button on your phone and you can even dictate your entries). <br><br>\u2022 Optional exclusive access to customized nutrition plans tailored for your goals<br><br>\u2022 Food &amp; Movement Log - syncs with most wearable devices <br><br>\u2022 Intermittent fasting timer for your meal plans <br><br>\u2022 Features over 20 different meal plans to choose from including paleo, keto, vegan and more\u2026<br><br>\u2022 Optional Group and Cleanse Programs if you want to be part of group support and community<br><br>\u2022 100s of recipes<br><br>\u2022 Option to customize and upgrade to 1:1 coaching, nutrition sessions<br><br>\u2022 And so much more!<br><br><br>DJN also allows you to track your progress in key areas (see list below) that other apps don\u2019t include. To truly live a healthier lifestyle is not solely focused on your weight or what\u2019s on your plate \u2013 it\u2019s also how you feel, sleep, your energy, digestion and so on.  This app also uniquely offers the option to have nutritionist Derek Johnson follow along in your progress and make recommendations along the way (additional). Just imagine, the more you track what you\u2019re eating and doing, the easier it is for Derek to understand how your selected plan is working for you, where it needs to be adjusted and how best to support you in your journey. Staying on track is easy for some, but if you need custom personal guidance and support directly from him, that\u2019s an option too! <br><br>Get ready to charge of your health, change your relationship with food and not only reach your goals - but maintain your results once and for all!<br><br>Let\u2019s do this!",

With over 24+ years experience in the nutrition field, expert holistic nutritionist Derek Johnson\u2019s DJN mobile app is your ultimate resource to make your wellness journey simple, realistic and maintainable!  <br><br>Designed with your personalized success in mind, the DJN app makes following a health and wellness plan easy! Once you select one (ex: paleo, keto, etc), you\u2019ll gain access to the info, recipes, meal plans, shopping lists, daily summaries and recommended supplements to achieve your goals. Following your plan and logging your progress is simple. From the Tracking Dashboard you\u2019ll have easy access to the different aspects of your specific plan: <br><br>Body \u2013 How are you sleeping? Have you lost weight? What is your heart rate? Your app is pre-configured so that you can track what factors are important to your individual wellness program by syncing with most wearable devices. <br><br>Nutrition \u2013 What are you eating? Take a photo of your food, type in a note, log the plan items you&#39;re consuming (and even the off-plan items too). The more you see the reality of your food choices, the easier it will be to make modifications. <br><br>Meditation \u2013 If mindfulness or meditation is part of your wellness program, you can record time spent meditating. <br><br>Condition \u2013 How are you feeling? Are you tired? Depressed? Feeling bloated after meals? Craving sugar? Tracking daily symptoms allows for correlating how you feel to what you are doing for movement, supplements and especially, nutrition.<br><br>Movement \u2013 Are you moving? Walking? Stretching? Doing yoga? Track it! Are you wearing a Fitbit, Apple Watch or another wearable? You can automatically upload/sync your data into the DJN app. <br><br>Journal \u2013 People who journal or track what they do are more successful at following a plan. In this app, you can record all the details of what you\u2019re eating and drinking (just use the Home or microphone button on your phone and you can even dictate your entries). <br><br>\u2022 Optional exclusive access to customized nutrition plans tailored for your goals<br><br>\u2022 Food &amp; Movement Log - syncs with most wearable devices <br><br>\u2022 Intermittent fasting timer for your meal plans <br><br>\u2022 Features over 20 different meal plans to choose from including paleo, keto, vegan and more\u2026<br><br>\u2022 Optional Group and Cleanse Programs if you want to be part of group support and community<br><br>\u2022 100s of recipes<br><br>\u2022 Option to customize and upgrade to 1:1 coaching, nutrition sessions<br><br>\u2022 And so much more!<br><br><br>DJN also allows you to track your progress in key areas (see list below) that other apps don\u2019t include. To truly live a healthier lifestyle is not solely focused on your weight or what\u2019s on your plate \u2013 it\u2019s also how you feel, sleep, your energy, digestion and so on.  This app also uniquely offers the option to have nutritionist Derek Johnson follow along in your progress and make recommendations along the way (additional). Just imagine, the more you track what you\u2019re eating and doing, the easier it is for Derek to understand how your selected plan is working for you, where it needs to be adjusted and how best to support you in your journey. Staying on track is easy for some, but if you need custom personal guidance and support directly from him, that\u2019s an option too! <br><br>Get ready to charge of your health, change your relationship with food and not only reach your goals - but maintain your results once and for all!<br><br>Let\u2019s do this!",

With over 24+ years experience in the nutrition field, expert holistic nutritionist Derek Johnson\u2019s DJN mobile app is your ultimate resource to make your wellness journey simple, realistic and maintainable!  <br><br>Designed with your personalized success in mind, the DJN app makes following a health and wellness plan easy! Once you select one (ex: paleo, keto, etc), you\u2019ll gain access to the info, recipes, meal plans, shopping lists, daily summaries and recommended supplements to achieve your goals. Following your plan and logging your progress is simple. From the Tracking Dashboard you\u2019ll have easy access to the different aspects of your specific plan: <br><br>Body \u2013 How are you sleeping? Have you lost weight? What is your heart rate? Your app is pre-configured so that you can track what factors are important to your individual wellness program by syncing with most wearable devices. <br><br>Nutrition \u2013 What are you eating? Take a photo of your food, type in a note, log the plan items you&#39;re consuming (and even the off-plan items too). The more you see the reality of your food choices, the easier it will be to make modifications. <br><br>Meditation \u2013 If mindfulness or meditation is part of your wellness program, you can record time spent meditating. <br><br>Condition \u2013 How are you feeling? Are you tired? Depressed? Feeling bloated after meals? Craving sugar? Tracking daily symptoms allows for correlating how you feel to what you are doing for movement, supplements and especially, nutrition.<br><br>Movement \u2013 Are you moving? Walking? Stretching? Doing yoga? Track it! Are you wearing a Fitbit, Apple Watch or another wearable? You can automatically upload/sync your data into the DJN app. <br><br>Journal \u2013 People who journal or track what they do are more successful at following a plan. In this app, you can record all the details of what you\u2019re eating and drinking (just use the Home or microphone button on your phone and you can even dictate your entries). <br><br>\u2022 Optional exclusive access to customized nutrition plans tailored for your goals<br><br>\u2022 Food &amp; Movement Log - syncs with most wearable devices <br><br>\u2022 Intermittent fasting timer for your meal plans <br><br>\u2022 Features over 20 different meal plans to choose from including paleo, keto, vegan and more\u2026<br><br>\u2022 Optional Group and Cleanse Programs if you want to be part of group support and community<br><br>\u2022 100s of recipes<br><br>\u2022 Option to customize and upgrade to 1:1 coaching, nutrition sessions<br><br>\u2022 And so much more!<br><br><br>DJN also allows you to track your progress in key areas (see list below) that other apps don\u2019t include. To truly live a healthier lifestyle is not solely focused on your weight or what\u2019s on your plate \u2013 it\u2019s also how you feel, sleep, your energy, digestion and so on.  This app also uniquely offers the option to have nutritionist Derek Johnson follow along in your progress and make recommendations along the way (additional). Just imagine, the more you track what you\u2019re eating and doing, the easier it is for Derek to understand how your selected plan is working for you, where it needs to be adjusted and how best to support you in your journey. Staying on track is easy for some, but if you need custom personal guidance and support directly from him, that\u2019s an option too! <br><br>Get ready to charge of your health, change your relationship with food and not only reach your goals - but maintain your results once and for all!<br><br>Let\u2019s do this!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Ready to commit to a healthier lifestyle but are unsure of where to start, what to eat or even how to maintain any results? With over 24+ years experience in the nutrition field, expert holistic nutritionist Derek Johnson\u2019s DJN mobile app is your ultimate resource to make your wellness journey simple, realistic and maintainable!  <br><br>Designed with your personalized success in mind, the DJN app makes following a health and wellness plan easy! Once you select one (ex: paleo, keto, etc), you\u2019ll gain access to the info, recipes, meal plans, shopping lists, daily summaries and recommended supplements to achieve your goals. Following your plan and logging your progress is simple. From the Tracking Dashboard you\u2019ll have easy access to the different aspects of your specific plan: <br><br>Body \u2013 How are you sleeping? Have you lost weight? What is your heart rate? Your app is pre-configured so that you can track what factors are important to your individual wellness program by syncing with most wearable devices. <br><br>Nutrition \u2013 What are you eating? Take a photo of your food, type in a note, log the plan items you&#39;re consuming (and even the off-plan items too). The more you see the reality of your food choices, the easier it will be to make modifications. <br><br>Meditation \u2013 If mindfulness or meditation is part of your wellness program, you can record time spent meditating. <br><br>Condition \u2013 How are you feeling? Are you tired? Depressed? Feeling bloated after meals? Craving sugar? Tracking daily symptoms allows for correlating how you feel to what you are doing for movement, supplements and especially, nutrition.<br><br>Movement \u2013 Are you moving? Walking? Stretching? Doing yoga? Track it! Are you wearing a Fitbit, Apple Watch or another wearable? You can automatically upload/sync your data into the DJN app. <br><br>Journal \u2013 People who journal or track what they do are more successful at following a plan. In this app, you can record all the details of what you\u2019re eating and drinking (just use the Home or microphone button on your phone and you can even dictate your entries). <br><br>\u2022 Optional exclusive access to customized nutrition plans tailored for your goals<br><br>\u2022 Food &amp; Movement Log - syncs with most wearable devices <br><br>\u2022 Intermittent fasting timer for your meal plans <br><br>\u2022 Features over 20 different meal plans to choose from including paleo, keto, vegan and more\u2026<br><br>\u2022 Optional Group and Cleanse Programs if you want to be part of group support and community<br><br>\u2022 100s of recipes<br><br>\u2022 Option to customize and upgrade to 1:1 coaching, nutrition sessions<br><br>\u2022 And so much more!<br><br><br>DJN also allows you to track your progress in key areas (see list below) that other apps don\u2019t include. To truly live a healthier lifestyle is not solely focused on your weight or what\u2019s on your plate \u2013 it\u2019s also how you feel, sleep, your energy, digestion and so on.  This app also uniquely offers the option to have nutritionist Derek Johnson follow along in your progress and make recommendations along the way (additional). Just imagine, the more you track what you\u2019re eating and doing, the easier it is for Derek to understand how your selected plan is working for you, where it needs to be adjusted and how best to support you in your journey. Staying on track is easy for some, but if you need custom personal guidance and support directly from him, that\u2019s an option too! <br><br>Get ready to charge of your health, change your relationship with food and not only reach your goals - but maintain your results once and for all!<br><br>Let\u2019s do this!",

    "descriptionHtml": "<h2>Mohafiz- your life saving mobile application!</h2><br><br><br>Designed to be a master platform for all emergencies, Mohafiz performs the following functions:<br>1. Lets you broadcast your emergencies through SMS and Twitter to those whom you know will drop everything to come to your aid when your life depends on it. <br>2. Lets you send and receive Blood Donations from registered volunteer donors in your city.<br>3. Apprises you of developing situations in your city that may impact your quality of life or the life of those that you love through its Mohafiz News Feed.<br>4. Contains a pre-programmed list of emergency numbers connecting you to the pertinent authorities in your city for any situation.<br><br><br>Today, right at this moment, we are vulnerable to a number of threats to our lives. From medical emergencies, house fires, road accidents, armed robberies to full blown terrorist attacks, and to top it all, we live in a third world country and like most third world countries there are some harsh realities to our way of life.  With the Mohafiz mobile application, not only are we encouraging each other to become each other\u2019s mohafiz, we are making the process simpler, allowing us to reach out to one another at the press of a button. When faced with a life-threatening emergency, such as being robbed at home or outside, a terrorist incident, a medical emergency or a car accident, use the Mohafiz App to alert your dependable loved ones that your life is in danger. <br><br><br>Mohafiz is an application that allows you to broadcast a life-threatening situation to your nominated In Case of Emergency (ICE) contacts through SMS. These may be your immediate family members, your neighbors, friends, colleagues, people whom you know and trust to let go of everything to come to your assistance when you need it the most.  <br><br><br>The application asks you to nominate 5 ICE contacts by selecting their numbers from your contacts list. As soon as this is done, an SMS is sent to these ICE contacts that they have been nominated by you to provide assistance in your state of emergency.<br><br><br>In an actual emergency situation, all you have to do is click on the application widget to launch the application. The screen will present two buttons; Red and Orange. The Red button is to be pressed if it is an immediate emergency and you don&#39;t have time to classify the nature of emergency. Pressing the red button immediately sends out an SMS containing your location and a general distress message to your ICE contacts. If your GPRS is active then the same will be transmitted through Twitter.<br><br><br>Press the orange button if you are involved in an evolving situation, because it presents options so that you can classify the nature of emergency that you are about to experience. This transmits the same message as the red button but also adds the exact nature of emergency faced by you so that your ICE contacts are better prepared to deal with it. The more information your ICE contact has, the better their response will be.<br><br><br>Mohafiz also allows you to send and receive Blood Donations from registered blood donors in your city. <br><br><br>An additional feature of Mohafiz is that it keeps on giving you news feeds about security related news in the area that you are. This allows you to stay abreast of any developing situations so that you may plan your routes effectively. <br><br><br>Download the Mohafiz application today and become each others Mohafiz. Remember, he who saves one life it is as if he has saved all of humanity.",

    "descriptionHtml": "<h2>Mohafiz- your life saving mobile application!</h2><br><br><br>Designed to be a master platform for all emergencies, Mohafiz performs the following functions:<br>1. Lets you broadcast your emergencies through SMS and Twitter to those whom you know will drop everything to come to your aid when your life depends on it. <br>2. Lets you send and receive Blood Donations from registered volunteer donors in your city.<br>3. Apprises you of developing situations in your city that may impact your quality of life or the life of those that you love through its Mohafiz News Feed.<br>4. Contains a pre-programmed list of emergency numbers connecting you to the pertinent authorities in your city for any situation.<br><br><br>Today, right at this moment, we are vulnerable to a number of threats to our lives. From medical emergencies, house fires, road accidents, armed robberies to full blown terrorist attacks, and to top it all, we live in a third world country and like most third world countries there are some harsh realities to our way of life.  With the Mohafiz mobile application, not only are we encouraging each other to become each other\u2019s mohafiz, we are making the process simpler, allowing us to reach out to one another at the press of a button. When faced with a life-threatening emergency, such as being robbed at home or outside, a terrorist incident, a medical emergency or a car accident, use the Mohafiz App to alert your dependable loved ones that your life is in danger. <br><br><br>Mohafiz is an application that allows you to broadcast a life-threatening situation to your nominated In Case of Emergency (ICE) contacts through SMS. These may be your immediate family members, your neighbors, friends, colleagues, people whom you know and trust to let go of everything to come to your assistance when you need it the most.  <br><br><br>The application asks you to nominate 5 ICE contacts by selecting their numbers from your contacts list. As soon as this is done, an SMS is sent to these ICE contacts that they have been nominated by you to provide assistance in your state of emergency.<br><br><br>In an actual emergency situation, all you have to do is click on the application widget to launch the application. The screen will present two buttons; Red and Orange. The Red button is to be pressed if it is an immediate emergency and you don&#39;t have time to classify the nature of emergency. Pressing the red button immediately sends out an SMS containing your location and a general distress message to your ICE contacts. If your GPRS is active then the same will be transmitted through Twitter.<br><br><br>Press the orange button if you are involved in an evolving situation, because it presents options so that you can classify the nature of emergency that you are about to experience. This transmits the same message as the red button but also adds the exact nature of emergency faced by you so that your ICE contacts are better prepared to deal with it. The more information your ICE contact has, the better their response will be.<br><br><br>Mohafiz also allows you to send and receive Blood Donations from registered blood donors in your city. <br><br><br>An additional feature of Mohafiz is that it keeps on giving you news feeds about security related news in the area that you are. This allows you to stay abreast of any developing situations so that you may plan your routes effectively. <br><br><br>Download the Mohafiz application today and become each others Mohafiz. Remember, he who saves one life it is as if he has saved all of humanity.",

    "descriptionHtml": "<h2>Mohafiz- your life saving mobile application!</h2><br><br><br>Designed to be a master platform for all emergencies, Mohafiz performs the following functions:<br>1. Lets you broadcast your emergencies through SMS and Twitter to those whom you know will drop everything to come to your aid when your life depends on it. <br>2. Lets you send and receive Blood Donations from registered volunteer donors in your city.<br>3. Apprises you of developing situations in your city that may impact your quality of life or the life of those that you love through its Mohafiz News Feed.<br>4. Contains a pre-programmed list of emergency numbers connecting you to the pertinent authorities in your city for any situation.<br><br><br>Today, right at this moment, we are vulnerable to a number of threats to our lives. From medical emergencies, house fires, road accidents, armed robberies to full blown terrorist attacks, and to top it all, we live in a third world country and like most third world countries there are some harsh realities to our way of life.  With the Mohafiz mobile application, not only are we encouraging each other to become each other\u2019s mohafiz, we are making the process simpler, allowing us to reach out to one another at the press of a button. When faced with a life-threatening emergency, such as being robbed at home or outside, a terrorist incident, a medical emergency or a car accident, use the Mohafiz App to alert your dependable loved ones that your life is in danger. <br><br><br>Mohafiz is an application that allows you to broadcast a life-threatening situation to your nominated In Case of Emergency (ICE) contacts through SMS. These may be your immediate family members, your neighbors, friends, colleagues, people whom you know and trust to let go of everything to come to your assistance when you need it the most.  <br><br><br>The application asks you to nominate 5 ICE contacts by selecting their numbers from your contacts list. As soon as this is done, an SMS is sent to these ICE contacts that they have been nominated by you to provide assistance in your state of emergency.<br><br><br>In an actual emergency situation, all you have to do is click on the application widget to launch the application. The screen will present two buttons; Red and Orange. The Red button is to be pressed if it is an immediate emergency and you don&#39;t have time to classify the nature of emergency. Pressing the red button immediately sends out an SMS containing your location and a general distress message to your ICE contacts. If your GPRS is active then the same will be transmitted through Twitter.<br><br><br>Press the orange button if you are involved in an evolving situation, because it presents options so that you can classify the nature of emergency that you are about to experience. This transmits the same message as the red button but also adds the exact nature of emergency faced by you so that your ICE contacts are better prepared to deal with it. The more information your ICE contact has, the better their response will be.<br><br><br>Mohafiz also allows you to send and receive Blood Donations from registered blood donors in your city. <br><br><br>An additional feature of Mohafiz is that it keeps on giving you news feeds about security related news in the area that you are. This allows you to stay abreast of any developing situations so that you may plan your routes effectively. <br><br><br>Download the Mohafiz application today and become each others Mohafiz. Remember, he who saves one life it is as if he has saved all of humanity.",

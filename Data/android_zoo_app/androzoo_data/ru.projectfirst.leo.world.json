    "descriptionHtml": "<b>Create your own fantastic world together with Leo the Truck! Time for Adventure!</b><br><br>Leo\u2019s World is a continuation of a series of well-known games about Leo the Truck and his friends. <br>In our new game, children will have to create the game\u2019s world themselves, gradually expanding its borders and possibilities within the world. Waiting for them are fun adventures with their favorite characters, many a discovery to make, educational sections in the form of various games and activities, entertaining animations and waves of positive emotion!<br><br>The game is aimed at children from the ages of 2 to 5 and comes with lots of minigames and activities to help develop children\u2019s visual and logical thinking, fine motor skills and visual memory. They also train attention span and reaction speeds, also allowing them room for artistic self-expression and teaching them to try new things.<br><br>You\u2019ll can always choose the desired level of difficulty and image quality in the settings menu.  Your child won\u2019t have access to all parts of the game: the settings page, shop purchases, and links to our other games are locked behind a parental control window!<br><br>You and your child will definitely enjoy the game\u2019s lively, bright and interesting world, its easy-to-grasp gameplay, and its professional voice acting!<br><br><b>Locations.</b><br>Leo\u2019s World is broken down into in-game locations and zones, each of which has many of its own in-game items. Locations are structured so that at the start of the game a number of these items will be inaccessible. By exploring the surrounding world of the game with the help of their chosen character, your child will gradually expand its borders, constantly discovering new aspects of the world \u2013 just like in real life.<br><br>Leo the Truck\u2019s world is alive and interactive. Tell your child to explore it, to examine the objects in a location and to tap on them. There are tons of surprises and fun animations in store for them!<br><br><b>Ice Cream.</b><br>Feed Leo and his friends ice cream! Each character wants ice cream made from a specific fruit or berry (which the narrator will announce).<br>This minigame helps children learn the names of fruits, berries, and their colors.<br><br><b>The Car Wash.</b><br>Our car wash isn\u2019t working. An accident\u2019s happened nearby and the pipe\u2019s burst. Fix the pipe using a Helper Car and get the car wash running. Choose a character and wash them down, then use the hair dryer to get them dry. <br>This minigame develops fine motor skills.<br><br><b>Coloring.</b><br>Color in pictures with the paintbrush by moving your finger or by filling in separate sections with the \u201cbucket\u201d tool.<br>This minigame allows room for artistic self-expression and teaches children to experiment.<br><br><b>Puzzles.</b><br>Put together the puzzle as quickly as you can!<br>Drag each piece to the right spot (where the puzzle edges match up with the shape of the piece), and they should automatically stick to the picture.<br>This minigame develops visual and logical thinking, as well as fine motor skills.<br><br><b>Rocket.</b><br>Find a way to get to the rocket, put it together, then head off on an exciting adventure to one of the Solar System\u2019s many planets.<br>Dodge asteroids and flying saucers. Shoot at them and earn bonus awards. Try reaching planets without bumping into anything. There\u2019ll be a surprise waiting at the end of your flight!<br>This minigame develops a child\u2019s attention span and reaction speed.  <br><br><b>Memory Cards.</b><br>Several pairs of cards are displayed on the screen with their reverse side showing. Tap on them to reveal them, trying to find the matching pairs.<br>This minigame trains visual memory.<br><br>Our team creates fun, high-quality, educational games and applications for young children, based on original content that we create and produce in our own animation studios.

    "descriptionHtml": "<b>Create your own fantastic world together with Leo the Truck! Time for Adventure!</b><br><br>Leo\u2019s World is a continuation of a series of well-known games about Leo the Truck and his friends. <br>In our new game, children will have to create the game\u2019s world themselves, gradually expanding its borders and possibilities within the world. Waiting for them are fun adventures with their favorite characters, many a discovery to make, educational sections in the form of various games and activities, entertaining animations and waves of positive emotion!<br><br>The game is aimed at children from the ages of 2 to 5 and comes with lots of minigames and activities to help develop children\u2019s visual and logical thinking, fine motor skills and visual memory. They also train attention span and reaction speeds, also allowing them room for artistic self-expression and teaching them to try new things.<br><br>You\u2019ll can always choose the desired level of difficulty and image quality in the settings menu.  Your child won\u2019t have access to all parts of the game: the settings page, shop purchases, and links to our other games are locked behind a parental control window!<br><br>You and your child will definitely enjoy the game\u2019s lively, bright and interesting world, its easy-to-grasp gameplay, and its professional voice acting!<br><br><b>Locations.</b><br>Leo\u2019s World is broken down into in-game locations and zones, each of which has many of its own in-game items. Locations are structured so that at the start of the game a number of these items will be inaccessible. By exploring the surrounding world of the game with the help of their chosen character, your child will gradually expand its borders, constantly discovering new aspects of the world \u2013 just like in real life.<br><br>Leo the Truck\u2019s world is alive and interactive. Tell your child to explore it, to examine the objects in a location and to tap on them. There are tons of surprises and fun animations in store for them!<br><br><b>Ice Cream.</b><br>Feed Leo and his friends ice cream! Each character wants ice cream made from a specific fruit or berry (which the narrator will announce).<br>This minigame helps children learn the names of fruits, berries, and their colors.<br><br><b>The Car Wash.</b><br>Our car wash isn\u2019t working. An accident\u2019s happened nearby and the pipe\u2019s burst. Fix the pipe using a Helper Car and get the car wash running. Choose a character and wash them down, then use the hair dryer to get them dry. <br>This minigame develops fine motor skills.<br><br><b>Coloring.</b><br>Color in pictures with the paintbrush by moving your finger or by filling in separate sections with the \u201cbucket\u201d tool.<br>This minigame allows room for artistic self-expression and teaches children to experiment.<br><br><b>Puzzles.</b><br>Put together the puzzle as quickly as you can!<br>Drag each piece to the right spot (where the puzzle edges match up with the shape of the piece), and they should automatically stick to the picture.<br>This minigame develops visual and logical thinking, as well as fine motor skills.<br><br><b>Rocket.</b><br>Find a way to get to the rocket, put it together, then head off on an exciting adventure to one of the Solar System\u2019s many planets.<br>Dodge asteroids and flying saucers. Shoot at them and earn bonus awards. Try reaching planets without bumping into anything. There\u2019ll be a surprise waiting at the end of your flight!<br>This minigame develops a child\u2019s attention span and reaction speed.  <br><br><b>Memory Cards.</b><br>Several pairs of cards are displayed on the screen with their reverse side showing. Tap on them to reveal them, trying to find the matching pairs.<br>This minigame trains visual memory.<br><br>Our team creates fun, high-quality, educational games and applications for young children, based on original content that we create and produce in our own animation studios.

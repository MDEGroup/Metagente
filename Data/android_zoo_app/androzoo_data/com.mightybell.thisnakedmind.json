    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved.

This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019.

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment.

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet.

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*.

In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment.

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet.

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment.

This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved.

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment.

This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them.

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment.

This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them.

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them.

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment.

In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019.

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved.

We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them.

    "descriptionHtml": "Join the global community, created by Annie Grace, that started the Sober Curious movement and is dedicated to exploring our relationship with alcohol without rules, blame, or shame. <br><br>We believe you can Drink Less, Moderate, Get Sober, Stop Drinking or anything in between. This journey is up to YOU and you alone and, if you join us, you will NEVER be judged for your personal journey.   <br><br>We will never tell you that you have to stop drinking. In fact, we care much more about how you want to feel than how much you drink. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in labels like \u2018alcoholic\u2019. In fact, we help you understand why labels like this are scientifically incorrect and often keep people drinking more than they would like. <br><br>We don\u2019t believe in \u2018relapse,\u2019 \u2018falling off the wagon,\u2019 or \u2018starting over\u2019. In fact, the idea that this is an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 journey often makes people unwilling to question their relationship with alcohol. <br><br>We believe there are far better questions than: \u2018am I an alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018do I need to stop drinking\u2019. In fact, the best question you can ask yourself is \u201cwould I be happier drinking a bit less alcohol?\u201d <br><br>(And then go through The Alcohol Experiment to find out! The answers may surprise you as they have hundreds of thousands of others.) <br><br>We believe (and can prove with neuroscience) that your drinking too much *is not your fault!*. In fact, we KNOW that you have been doing the best you can with the tools you have, you\u2019ve just been given the wrong tools. <br><br>We help you realize your true POWER in this conversation. In fact, we\u2019ve seen science that proves that accepting powerlessness is contrary to lasting change. <br><br>And most importantly, we believe that just because you drink too much doesn\u2019t mean you are broken (or diseased or doomed or anything else). In fact, when you awaken self compassion, which we do all day every day, instead of shame and blame, your path to change becomes easier (and dare we say, even fun!)<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Free access to The Alcohol Experiment. A 30 day challenge that over 350,000 people have loved. As featured in: People Magazine, Good Morning America, Forbes, Red Table Talk, The Wall Street Journal, Nightline, NPR, Newsweek and The BBC. <br><br>*Free lifetime access to 300+ Q&amp;A Videos that explore topics like; how to socialize without a drink, sober sex, why is drinking so hard for some and easy for others, is there a genetic component to drinking too much, and so much more. <br><br>*The best global community on the planet. We are all here to support each other, no matter where we are or where we came from. <br><br>*Live streams and events throughout the year where you can join Annie Grace &amp; Scott Pinyard as well as other This Naked Mind Certified Coaches LIVE.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>TOPICS WE EXPLORE<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Alcohol<br>*Neuroscience<br>*Mental Health<br>*Personal Development<br>*Habit Change<br>*Sobriety<br>*Sober Curious<br>*Alcoholism <br>*Living Alcohol Free<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>INSIDE THE APP<br>-----------------------------------<br>*Public and Private Communities<br>*Single destination for all TNM Programs<br>*Full TNM Event Calendar<br>*Podcast library<br>*Searchable Q&amp;A video library with over 300 videos <br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>ABOUT THIS NAKED MIND<br>------------------------------------------<br>We aim to provide effective, grace-led and compassion-led programs based on This Naked Mind &amp; The Alcohol Experiment that are aimed to help people find peace, joy, and freedom in their lives by taking control of their relationship with alcohol - whatever that means to them. And we aim to prove our methods through science and efficacy-based studies that ultimately revolutionize the way addiction is treated to make it more effective, science-based and with a foundation of grace &amp; compassion.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game!<br>Further down in the section &quot;Improvements compared to the first version&quot; you will find all the changes compared to the first version.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when they had to play it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for children and adults.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or sum up 10. For example 7 and 3, 9 and 1 or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. By doing this you can skip crossed out numbers.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you must press &quot;Check&quot;. With &quot;Check&quot; all remaining numbers are written behind all already existing numbers.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there is no more possibility<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Statistics: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field can be viewed<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Also playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- It is possible to cross out single numbers<br>- It is now also possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- It is now possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can change numbers to icons now<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved color picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Depending on how the game is played and how you strike through number by number, digit by digit, the game may take longer or less. But you can cross out all numbers in almost all cases, you might need some patience (or use a boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game (there still version 1) from a user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend this website: http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/<br>In addition to an introduction, there is also a very elaborate strategy.<br><br>Try this different number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Also this version of the Numbers Game - Numberama is completely ad-free and does not use critical permissions. In addition, it takes up little memory space. It is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, other number puzzles or crossword puzzles and therefore a patience and casual game for everyone. Try to cross out all numbers in the best time killer ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email. I would also appreciate help for improving the english translation.<br><br>Lars",

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game!<br>Further down in the section &quot;Improvements compared to the first version&quot; you will find all the changes compared to the first version.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when they had to play it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for children and adults.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or sum up 10. For example 7 and 3, 9 and 1 or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. By doing this you can skip crossed out numbers.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you must press &quot;Check&quot;. With &quot;Check&quot; all remaining numbers are written behind all already existing numbers.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there is no more possibility<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Statistics: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field can be viewed<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Also playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- It is possible to cross out single numbers<br>- It is now also possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- It is now possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can change numbers to icons now<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved color picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Depending on how the game is played and how you strike through number by number, digit by digit, the game may take longer or less. But you can cross out all numbers in almost all cases, you might need some patience (or use a boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game (there still version 1) from a user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend this website: http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/<br>In addition to an introduction, there is also a very elaborate strategy.<br><br>Try this different number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Also this version of the Numbers Game - Numberama is completely ad-free and does not use critical permissions. In addition, it takes up little memory space. It is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, other number puzzles or crossword puzzles and therefore a patience and casual game for everyone. Try to cross out all numbers in the best time killer ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email. I would also appreciate help for improving the english translation.<br><br>Lars",

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game!<br>Further down in the section &quot;Improvements compared to the first version&quot; you will find all the changes compared to the first version.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when they had to play it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for children and adults.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or sum up 10. For example 7 and 3, 9 and 1 or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. By doing this you can skip crossed out numbers.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you must press &quot;Check&quot;. With &quot;Check&quot; all remaining numbers are written behind all already existing numbers.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there is no more possibility<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Statistics: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field can be viewed<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Also playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- It is possible to cross out single numbers<br>- It is now also possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- It is now possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can change numbers to icons now<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved color picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Depending on how the game is played and how you strike through number by number, digit by digit, the game may take longer or less. But you can cross out all numbers in almost all cases, you might need some patience (or use a boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game (there still version 1) from a user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend this website: http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/<br>In addition to an introduction, there is also a very elaborate strategy.<br><br>Try this different number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Also this version of the Numbers Game - Numberama is completely ad-free and does not use critical permissions. In addition, it takes up little memory space. It is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, other number puzzles or crossword puzzles and therefore a patience and casual game for everyone. Try to cross out all numbers in the best time killer ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email. I would also appreciate help for improving the english translation.<br><br>Lars",

Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game!<br>Further down in the section &quot;Improvements compared to the first version&quot; you will find all the changes compared to the first version.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for children and adults.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved color picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same). As well as an introduction, there is also a very elaborate strategy.<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game - Numberama 2 is completely ad-free and it takes up little memory space. It is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game!<br>Further down in the section &quot;Improvements compared to the first version&quot; you will find all the changes compared to the first version.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for children and adults.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved color picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same). As well as an introduction, there is also a very elaborate strategy.<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game - Numberama 2 is completely ad-free and it takes up little memory space. It is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved color picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours.

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game!<br>Further down in the section &quot;Improvements compared to the first version&quot; you will find all the changes compared to the first version.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for children and adults.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved color picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same). As well as an introduction, there is also a very elaborate strategy.<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game - Numberama 2 is completely ad-free and it takes up little memory space. It is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone.

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game!<br>Further down in the section &quot;Improvements compared to the first version&quot; you will find all the changes compared to the first version.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for children and adults.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved color picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same). As well as an introduction, there is also a very elaborate strategy.<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game - Numberama 2 is completely ad-free and it takes up little memory space. It is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for children and adults.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game!<br>Further down in the section &quot;Improvements compared to the first version&quot; you will find all the changes compared to the first version.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for children and adults.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved color picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same). As well as an introduction, there is also a very elaborate strategy.<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game - Numberama 2 is completely ad-free and it takes up little memory space. It is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

A classic brain game for children and adults.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game!<br>Further down in the section &quot;Improvements compared to the first version&quot; you will find all the changes compared to the first version.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for children and adults.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved colour picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game - Numberama 2 is completely ad-free and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, Seeds, or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, 2048, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game!<br>Further down in the section &quot;Improvements compared to the first version&quot; you will find all the changes compared to the first version.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for children and adults.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved colour picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game - Numberama 2 is completely ad-free and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, Seeds, or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, 2048, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game!<br>Further down in the section &quot;Improvements compared to the first version&quot; you will find all the changes compared to the first version.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for children and adults.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved colour picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game - Numberama 2 is completely ad-free and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, Seeds, or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, 2048, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game!<br>Further down in the section &quot;Improvements compared to the first version&quot; you will find all the changes compared to the first version.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for children and adults.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved colour picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game - Numberama 2 is completely ad-free and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, Seeds, or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, 2048, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game!<br>Further down in the section &quot;Improvements compared to the first version&quot; you will find all the changes compared to the first version.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved colour picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game - Numberama 2 is completely ad-free and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, Seeds, or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, 2048, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game!<br>Further down in the section &quot;Improvements compared to the first version&quot; you will find all the changes compared to the first version.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved colour picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game - Numberama 2 is completely ad-free and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, Seeds, or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, 2048, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game!<br>Further down in the section &quot;Improvements compared to the first version&quot; you will find all the changes compared to the first version.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved colour picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game - Numberama 2 is completely ad-free and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, Seeds, or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, 2048, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game!<br>Further down in the section &quot;Improvements compared to the first version&quot; you will find all the changes compared to the first version.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to 10. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved colour picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers!

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>\ud83d\udcc8 Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>\u23f0 Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>\ud83d\udd28 Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version \ud83d\udcaa</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved colour picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free, you won&#39;t find any ads, and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, 10 Seeds, Numberzilla or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, 2048, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer and brain game ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>\ud83d\udcc8 Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>\u23f0 Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>\ud83d\udd28 Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version \ud83d\udcaa</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved colour picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers!

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>\ud83d\udcc8 Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>\u23f0 Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>\ud83d\udd28 Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version \ud83d\udcaa</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved colour picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free, you won&#39;t find any ads, and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, 10 Seeds, Numberzilla or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, 2048, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer and brain game ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>\ud83d\udcc8 Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>\u23f0 Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>\ud83d\udd28 Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>\ud83d\udcc8 Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>\u23f0 Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>\ud83d\udd28 Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version \ud83d\udcaa</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved colour picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free, you won&#39;t find any ads, and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, 10 Seeds, Numberzilla or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known numbers games like Sudoku, 2048, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer and brain game ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved colour picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free, you won&#39;t find any ads, and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, 10 Seeds, Numberzilla or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known numbers or puzzle games like Sudoku, 2048, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer and brain game ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;.

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved colour picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free, you won&#39;t find any ads, and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, 10 Seeds, Numberzilla or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known numbers or puzzle games like Sudoku, 2048, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer and brain game ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved colour picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free, you won&#39;t find any ads, and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, 10 Seeds, Numberzilla or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known numbers or puzzle games like Sudoku, 2048, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer and brain game ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

    "descriptionHtml": "Try out the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved colour picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free, you won&#39;t find any ads, and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, 10 Seeds, Numberzilla or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known numbers or puzzle games like Sudoku, Nonogram, 2048, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer and brain game ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Lars",

The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop.

    "descriptionHtml": "This is the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Some of you may still know the Numbers Game from school or university when you might have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Improvements compared to the first version</b><br>- Level Mode!<br>- Mode Builder Mode!<br>- Boosts: Shuffle all numbers or remove some/all crossed out numbers<br>- Possible to cross out single numbers<br>- Possible to undo a move after deleting a line<br>- Possible to automatically scroll to the combination found by &quot;Help&quot;<br>- You can use icons rather than numbers<br>- Improved instruction<br>- Improved color picker<br>- Better performance<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free, you won&#39;t find any ads, and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, 10 Seeds, 1-19, Doodle, Numberzilla or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known numbers or puzzle games like Sudoku, Nonogram, 2048, other number puzzles, or crossword puzzles - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer and brain game ever!<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br>Lars",

    "descriptionHtml": "This is the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know the Numbers Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for adults and children.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br>Lars<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free, you won&#39;t find any ads, and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, 10 Seeds, 1-19, Doodle, Numberzilla or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number puzzle games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, other number puzzles, crossword puzzles or word puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer and brain game ever!",

    "descriptionHtml": "This is the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know the Numbers Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for adults and children.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br>Lars<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers!

    "descriptionHtml": "This is the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know the Numbers Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for adults and children.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br>Lars<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free, you won&#39;t find any ads, and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, 10 Seeds, 1-19, Doodle, Numberzilla or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number puzzle games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, other number puzzles, crossword puzzles or word puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer and brain game ever!",

Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for adults and children.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours.

    "descriptionHtml": "This is the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know the Numbers Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for adults and children.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br>Lars<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free, you won&#39;t find any ads, and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, 10 Seeds, 1-19, Doodle, Numberzilla or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number puzzle games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, other number puzzles, crossword puzzles or word puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer and brain game ever!",

The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know the Numbers Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads<br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free, you won&#39;t find any ads, and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, 10 Seeds, 1-19, Doodle, Numberzilla or Numbers it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number puzzle games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, other number puzzles, crossword puzzles or word puzzle games - a patience game for everyone.

    "descriptionHtml": "This is the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know the Numbers Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, 10 Seeds, 1-19 or Numberzilla it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number puzzle games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. The best time killer and brain game ever!",

The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know the Numbers Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Try this unique number puzzle now and try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, 10 Seeds, 1-19 or Numberzilla it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number puzzle games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone.

    "descriptionHtml": "This is the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know the Numbers Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, 10 Seeds, 1-19 or Numberzilla it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

    "descriptionHtml": "This is the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know the Numbers Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example, 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. Also known as Take Ten, 10 Seeds, 1-19 or Numberzilla it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

    "descriptionHtml": "This is the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know the Numbers Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has multiple names like Take Ten, 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

    "descriptionHtml": "This is the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know the Numbers Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has multiple names like Take Ten, 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone.

    "descriptionHtml": "This is the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know the Numbers Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colors or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has multiple names like Take Ten, 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

    "descriptionHtml": "This is the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know the Numbers Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has multiple names like Take Ten, 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know the Numbers Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers!

    "descriptionHtml": "This is the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know the Numbers Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has multiple names like Take Ten, 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

    "descriptionHtml": "This is the new and improved version of Numbers Game! The classic time killer with well-known rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know the Numbers Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to cross out all the numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes one game can take hours. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I can recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is for version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has multiple names like Take Ten, 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are equal, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

    "descriptionHtml": "Numbers Game 2 is the new and improved version of the addictive puzzle game! The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the number game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has many names like Take Ten, Match 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Numbers Game 2 is the new and improved version of the addictive puzzle game! The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the number game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has many names like Take Ten, Match 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Numbers Game 2 is the new and improved version of the addictive puzzle game! The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colors or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the number game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space.

    "descriptionHtml": "Numbers Game 2 is the new and improved version of the addictive puzzle game! The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the number game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has many names like Take Ten, Match 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Numbers Game 2 is the new and improved version of the addictive puzzle game! The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the number game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has many names like Take Ten, Match 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone.

    "descriptionHtml": "Numbers Game 2 is the new and improved version of the addictive puzzle game! The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the number game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has many names like Take Ten, Match 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Numbers Game 2 is the new and improved version of the addictive puzzle game! The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the number game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has many names like Take Ten, Match 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the number game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers!

    "descriptionHtml": "Numbers Game 2 is the new and improved version of the addictive puzzle game! The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the number game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has many names like Take Ten, Match 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Numbers Game 2 is the new and improved version of the addictive puzzle game! The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the number game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has many names like Take Ten, Match 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

    "descriptionHtml": "Numbers Game 2 is the new and improved version of the addictive puzzle game! The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the number game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has many names like Take Ten, Match 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

    "descriptionHtml": "Numbers Game 2 is the new and improved version of the addictive puzzle game! The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the number game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has many names like Take Ten, Match 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone.

    "descriptionHtml": "Numbers Game 2 is the new and improved version of the addictive puzzle game! The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the number game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has many names like Take Ten, Match 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Numbers Game 2 is the new and improved version of the addictive puzzle game! The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the number game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has many names like Take Ten, Match 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone.

    "descriptionHtml": "Numbers Game 2 is the new and improved version of the addictive puzzle game! The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the number game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has many names like Take Ten, Match 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Numbers Game 2 is the new and improved version of the addictive puzzle game! The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games (the amount depends on the mode) or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or improving the number game please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has many names like Take Ten, Match 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency.

    "descriptionHtml": "Numbers Game 2 is the new and improved version of the addictive puzzle game! The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules enriched with many new features.<br><br>Many of you know this Number Match Game from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now &quot;Numbers Game - Numberama 2&quot; is also available as an app for your smartphone. A classic brain game for everyone.<br><br><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br>In this logic game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be crossed out, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can match numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two numbers have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out numbers between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to cross out any more numbers and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the game continues. One big difference to all the Number block merge games is, that the two numbers are not merged creating a new number but crossed out.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the game<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own mode (1-18, 1-19 or random)<br><br>In each mode there are the following features:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move (for 3 coins each you can also undo several moves in a row)<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number pairs that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: For 5 coins you can strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Restart&quot;: Start the game from the beginning or start a new game<br>- &quot;Boosts - Shuffle&quot;: For 15 coins you can shuffle all the numbers on the board<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear 30%&quot;: For 15 coins you can remove 30% of all crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Boosts - Clear all&quot;: For 25 coins you can remove ALL crossed out numbers<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: The playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number at top/bottom<br>- Diagonal combinations in mode builder<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards and saved games<br><br>What are these coins?<br>The coins are an app-internal currency. With these you can use some of the features mentioned above. Coins can be obtained by solving games or by buying them in the shop. You can find the shop in the main menu.<br><br><b>Other</b><br>Some modes can be very difficult, and the time to complete the game depends on how you choose the pairs to cross out. Sometimes a game can take hours to clear the board. But you can cross out all the numbers in almost all cases, but you might need some patience (or use a Boost).<br><br>If you want an introduction to the game from a skilled user&#39;s point of view, I recommend http://www.rootbeer.co.nz/introduction-to-numbers-game-numberama/ (note that this is version 1, but the gameplay is the same).<br><br><b>Support</b><br>For help with translations or feedback please send me an email.<br><br>Try to cross out all the numbers! Numbers Game Numberama 2 is completely ad-free except that you have the opportunity to watch ads to get some coins as reward, and it takes up little memory space. This game has many names like Take Ten, Match 10 Seeds, 1-19 game, Numberzilla or Match Numbers and it is a great alternative to the well-known word or number games like Sudoku, Solitaire, Nonogram, 2048, or other puzzle games - a patience game for everyone. A real time killer and good brain game!",

For example you can combine numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two digits have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the number board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out number blocks between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to merge numbers, and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the numbers game continues.<br><br><b>Number Match Game Numberama 2</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the number games<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own numbers game (1-18, 1-19, or choose from ten digits randomly)<br><br>Use all of this in any of your number match games:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number blocks that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: Strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: Playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number blocks at top/bottom<br>- Diagonal numbers combinations in mode builder<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customizable number board (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want, you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards, achievements and saved games<br><br><b>Pair Matching Numbers Puzzle</b><br>Use your number games skills to find the matching pair combinations and solve the free logic puzzle.

Two numbers can be merged, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can combine numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two digits have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the number board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out number blocks between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to merge numbers, and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the numbers game continues.<br><br><b>Number Match Game Numberama 2</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the number games<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own numbers game (1-18, 1-19, or choose from ten digits randomly)<br><br>Use all of this in any of your number match games:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number blocks that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: Strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: Playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number blocks at top/bottom<br>- Diagonal numbers combinations in mode builder<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customisable number board (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want, you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards, achievements and saved games<br><br><b>Pair Matching Numbers Puzzle</b><br>Use your number games skills to find the matching pair combinations and solve the free logic puzzle.

Two numbers can be merged, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can combine numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two digits have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the number board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out number blocks between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to merge numbers, and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the numbers game continues.<br><br><b>Number Match Game Numberama 2</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the number games<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own numbers game (1-18, 1-19, or choose from ten digits randomly)<br><br>Use all of this in any of your number match games:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number blocks that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: Strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: Playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number blocks at top/bottom<br>- Diagonal numbers combinations in mode builder<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customisable number board (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want, you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards, achievements and saved games<br><br><b>Pair Matching Numbers Puzzle</b><br>Use your number games skills to find the matching pair combinations and solve the free logic puzzle.

Two numbers can be merged, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can combine numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.<br>The two digits have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the number board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out number blocks between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to merge numbers, and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;. All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the numbers game continues.<br><br><b>Number Match Game Numberama 2</b><br>There are three different modes:<br>- Level: Solve level after level with increasing difficulty<br>- Quick: The classic version of the numbers game with some features that speed up the number games<br>- Mode Builder: Create your own numbers game (1-18, 1-19, or choose from ten digits randomly)<br><br>Use all of this in any of your number match games:<br>- &quot;Undo&quot;: Undo the last move<br>- &quot;Help&quot;: Have a possible combination shown or get the info that there are no more number blocks that match<br>- &quot;Cross&quot;: Strike through any single number<br>- &quot;Statistics&quot;: Playing time and statistics for the current playing field are displayed<br>- Preview of next not crossed number blocks at top/bottom<br>- Diagonal numbers combinations in mode builder<br>- AutoClean: Empty lines are removed automatically<br>- Automatic save/load<br>- Highly customisable number board (change colours or numbers)<br>- Playable, without having to make in-app purchases<br>- No ads (if you want, you can watch ads to get coins) <br>- Minimum required permissions<br>- Google Play Games Services for leaderboards, achievements and saved games<br><br><b>Pair Matching Numbers Puzzle</b><br>Use your number games skills to find the matching pair combinations and solve the free logic puzzle.

The two numbers can have crossed-out number blocks between them.<br>If you cannot or do not want to merge numbers, and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press &quot;Check&quot;.

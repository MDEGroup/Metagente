Believe you can do it, keep trying and you will get there.\u2019<br><br>Worth Warrior is a free app created for young people to manage negative body image, low self-worth, and related early-stage eating difficulties or disorders. Created for teenage mental health charity stem4 by Dr Krause, a Consultant Clinical Psychologist, in collaboration with young people, the app uses principles from the evidence-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for eating disorders (CBT-E).<br><br>Like all stem4&#39;s award winning apps, it is free, private, anonymous, and safe.<br><br>The app provides a range of helpful activities and information, based on the notion that through learning to challenge and change thoughts, emotions, behaviours, and body image issues underlying low self-worth, eating and body related issues can be helped.<br><br>By identifying these underlying factors, and monitoring them over time, you can also start to identify what your triggers and maintaining factors are and work towards making positive change.<br><br>The \u2018Change the Story\u2019 section of the app helps identify negative self thought and learn how to substitute positive self-thoughts. \u2018Change the Action\u2019 focuses on identifying negative behaviours and altering them. In \u2018Change the Emotion\u2019 users are provided with alternative, self soothing behaviours to manipulate their eating and in \u2018Change the way I view my Body\u2019 users are taught how to separate fact from assumption.<br><br>There is also a range of information within the app for users to learn more about eating disorders, such as the importance of regular eating and hunger, the health consequences of eating-related behaviours, and issues that maintain eating disorders. <br><br>The app also allows users to build a \u2018safety net\u2019 of helpful thoughts, behaviours and people to contact, and signposts to help. Finally, users can monitor and keep track of which app activities help, record thoughts and feelings in a journal, and view daily motivators.<br><br>We understand the importance of privacy and so no identifiable data is collected in the app and no WIFI access or data is required.<br><br>It is built to NHS standards.<br><br>Please note that the Worth Warrior app is an aid in treatment but does not replace it.<br><br>Worth Warrior is the latest app in stem4\u2019s digital portfolio of apps that use evidence-based principles to help young people manage the symptoms of mental health difficulties and disorders. As of June 2022, stem4\u2019s existing apps (Calm Harm, Clear Fear, Combined Minds and Move Mood) have been downloaded over 3.25 million times, and have received various awards including:<br><br>- The Digital Leaders 100 Awards \u2018Tech for Good Initiative of the Year\u2019 in 2020, for stem4\u2019s full app portfolio<br><br>- The Health Tech Awards Winner \u2018Best Healthcare App of the Year\u2019 in 2021, for Calm Harm<br><br>- The CogX Awards Winner in \u2018Good Health and Well-Being\u2019 in 2020, for Clear Fear",

    "descriptionHtml": "\u2018To hit a target of worth takes practice and courage. Believe you can do it, keep trying and you will get there.\u2019<br><br>Worth Warrior is a free app created for young people to manage negative body image, low self-worth, and related early-stage eating difficulties or disorders. Created for teenage mental health charity stem4 by Dr Krause, a Consultant Clinical Psychologist, in collaboration with young people, the app uses principles from the evidence-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for eating disorders (CBT-E).<br><br>Like all stem4&#39;s award winning apps, it is free, private, anonymous, and safe.<br><br>The app provides a range of helpful activities and information, based on the notion that through learning to challenge and change thoughts, emotions, behaviours, and body image issues underlying low self-worth, eating and body related issues can be helped.<br><br>By identifying these underlying factors, and monitoring them over time, you can also start to identify what your triggers and maintaining factors are and work towards making positive change.<br><br>The \u2018Change the Story\u2019 section of the app helps identify negative self thought and learn how to substitute positive self-thoughts. \u2018Change the Action\u2019 focuses on identifying negative behaviours and altering them. In \u2018Change the Emotion\u2019 users are provided with alternative, self soothing behaviours to manipulate their eating and in \u2018Change the way I view my Body\u2019 users are taught how to separate fact from assumption.<br><br>There is also a range of information within the app for users to learn more about eating disorders, such as the importance of regular eating and hunger, the health consequences of eating-related behaviours, and issues that maintain eating disorders. <br><br>The app also allows users to build a \u2018safety net\u2019 of helpful thoughts, behaviours and people to contact, and signposts to help. Finally, users can monitor and keep track of which app activities help, record thoughts and feelings in a journal, and view daily motivators.<br><br>We understand the importance of privacy and so no identifiable data is collected in the app and no WIFI access or data is required.<br><br>It is built to NHS standards.<br><br>Please note that the Worth Warrior app is an aid in treatment but does not replace it.<br><br>Worth Warrior is the latest app in stem4\u2019s digital portfolio of apps that use evidence-based principles to help young people manage the symptoms of mental health difficulties and disorders. As of June 2022, stem4\u2019s existing apps (Calm Harm, Clear Fear, Combined Minds and Move Mood) have been downloaded over 3.25 million times, and have received various awards including:<br><br>- The Digital Leaders 100 Awards \u2018Tech for Good Initiative of the Year\u2019 in 2020, for stem4\u2019s full app portfolio<br><br>- The Health Tech Awards Winner \u2018Best Healthcare App of the Year\u2019 in 2021, for Calm Harm<br><br>- The CogX Awards Winner in \u2018Good Health and Well-Being\u2019 in 2020, for Clear Fear",

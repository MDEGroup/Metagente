    "descriptionHtml": "GreenQube is a platform for the farm value chain ecosystem to monitor and manage agriculture related issues, transactions and farmer decision support with a digital backbone.<br><br>GreenQube is an Android based mobile application for farmers, part of the Farm value chain ERP platform offered by InQube Innoventures Limited, UK. It is a decision support system for providing complete handholding information to farmers during all the phases of crop life cycle. There are modules like advisory on crop production, scientific farming practices, fertilizer and pesticide calculation, weather advisory, soil management and market information. GreenQube encompasses agro-tech features with an intent to fill the gap between farmers, farm related enterprises and accurate strategic information of agriculture expert. Hence enabling farmers to get efficient solution within no time.<br><br>We have included all the features here ensuring a win-win situation of farm sector enterprises and the farmers attached to them.<br><br>Features of GreenQube<br><br>1.

    "descriptionHtml": "GreenQube is a platform for the farm value chain ecosystem to monitor and manage agriculture related issues, transactions and farmer decision support with a digital backbone.<br><br>GreenQube is an Android based mobile application for farmers, part of the Farm value chain ERP platform offered by InQube Innoventures Limited, UK. It is a decision support system for providing complete handholding information to farmers during all the phases of crop life cycle.

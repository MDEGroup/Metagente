    "descriptionHtml": "<b>Chapter 7 of book 3 is now available.</b><br><br>Disclaimer: The game is only available in English. <br><br>Magium is a D&amp;D inspired text adventure game similar to old Choose your own story books (CYOA), in which you play as an ordinary guy named Barry, who joins a deadly mage tournament against the most powerful mages in the world in the hopes of using the prize to fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a mage himself.<br><br>As in all interactive novels, your choices will affect the story, and making wrong choices can even lead to your death. Besides the traditional choice making of regular Choose your own path games, Magium also has stats that you can upgrade with points that you will receive occasionally, throughout the game. These stats will be checked by the game from time to time, to see if they are high enough to allow you to perform certain actions. For example, if your ancient languages stat is high enough, you can understand what animals and monsters are saying.<br><br>The story of Magium starts at the beginning of the tournament, right after you and all the other participants were transported to the continent where the contest was taking place, and it is set in a medieval fantasy setting, with a dash of futuristic looking magical devices, which are relics of an ancient, technologically advanced civilization that crumbled hundreds of years before the beginning of the series. The world in which the story takes place is somewhat inspired from Dungeons and Dragons, so if you&#39;ve played D&amp;D before, you will likely find some similarities, especially regarding the magic system.<br><br>As the story progresses, you will meet with other participants, you will make friends and enemies, and you will find out more about the continent you are on, and its inhabitants. You will find out that a person called &quot;The Creator&quot; had established several utopias in this place, six hundred years ago, where animals and humans lived in harmony, and food was created through magic. What you will get to see, however, is the downfall of these utopias, some of them being on the brink of destruction. Your choices will influence what happens in these cities, and you can even choose to save them if you so desire.<br><br>The game will be divided into six or seven books, each of them consisting of more than a hundred thousand words.<br><br>The first book is now available in its entirety, and it can be played for free. It is approximately 178k words long, which translates to about 700 book pages. This number also takes into account the story&#39;s branching paths. The length of a playthrough on average should be about 90k words, so about 350 book pages.<br><br>The second book is now available in its entirety, but the next books have not been written yet, and they will be published chapter by chapter, as I write them. Unlike the first book, the second one will need to be unlocked before it can be played, and it will be the same for the next books as well. In order to unlock the second book, you will either need to complete 25 of the 35 available achievements, or pay to unlock it. All of the next books will also be unlockable in the same way.<br><br>The second book is 277k words in total, on all paths, which translates to about 1100 book pages. On one path, you should be seeing around half of those words, so roughly 140k, which would translate to 550 book pages or so.  <br><br>If you want to be notified about the game&#39;s updates, you can follow Magium Games on twitter by following this link: https://twitter.com/Magium_games or if you prefer to use Facebook for your updates, you can also follow the game&#39;s Facebook page at this link: https://www.facebook.com/Magium-Games-1933559536878087/<br><br>Credits for the game icon go to Agnes Landgraf.",

Besides the traditional choice making of regular Choose your own path games, Magium also has stats that you can upgrade with points that you will receive occasionally, throughout the game. These stats will be checked by the game from time to time, to see if they are high enough to allow you to perform certain actions. For example, if your ancient languages stat is high enough, you can understand what animals and monsters are saying.<br><br>The story of Magium starts at the beginning of the tournament, right after you and all the other participants were transported to the continent where the contest was taking place, and it is set in a medieval fantasy setting, with a dash of futuristic looking magical devices, which are relics of an ancient, technologically advanced civilization that crumbled hundreds of years before the beginning of the series. The world in which the story takes place is somewhat inspired from Dungeons and Dragons, so if you&#39;ve played D&amp;D before, you will likely find some similarities, especially regarding the magic system.<br><br>As the story progresses, you will meet with other participants, you will make friends and enemies, and you will find out more about the continent you are on, and its inhabitants. You will find out that a person called &quot;The Creator&quot; had established several utopias in this place, six hundred years ago, where animals and humans lived in harmony, and food was created through magic. What you will get to see, however, is the downfall of these utopias, some of them being on the brink of destruction. Your choices will influence what happens in these cities, and you can even choose to save them if you so desire.<br><br>The game will be divided into six or seven books, each of them consisting of more than a hundred thousand words.<br><br>The first book is now available in its entirety, and it can be played for free. It is approximately 178k words long, which translates to about 700 book pages. This number also takes into account the story&#39;s branching paths. The length of a playthrough on average should be about 90k words, so about 350 book pages.<br><br>The second book is now available in its entirety, but the next books have not been written yet, and they will be published chapter by chapter, as I write them. Unlike the first book, the second one will need to be unlocked before it can be played, and it will be the same for the next books as well. In order to unlock the second book, you will either need to complete 25 of the 35 available achievements, or pay to unlock it. All of the next books will also be unlockable in the same way.<br><br>The second book is 277k words in total, on all paths, which translates to about 1100 book pages. On one path, you should be seeing around half of those words, so roughly 140k, which would translate to 550 book pages or so.  <br><br>If you want to be notified about the game&#39;s updates, you can follow Magium Games on twitter by following this link: https://twitter.com/Magium_games or if you prefer to use Facebook for your updates, you can also follow the game&#39;s Facebook page at this link: https://www.facebook.com/Magium-Games-1933559536878087/<br><br>Credits for the game icon go to Agnes Landgraf.",

    "descriptionHtml": "<b>Disclaimer: The game is only available in English.</b><br><br>Magium is a DnD inspired text adventure game similar to old Choose your own story books (CYOA), in which you play as an ordinary guy named Barry, who joins a deadly mage tournament against the most powerful mages in the world in the hopes of using the prize to fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a mage himself.<br><br>As in all interactive novels, your choices will affect the story, and making wrong choices can even lead to your death. Besides the traditional choice making of regular Choose your own path games, Magium also has stats that you can upgrade with points that you will receive occasionally, throughout the game. These stats will be checked by the game from time to time, to see if they are high enough to allow you to perform certain actions. For example, if your ancient languages stat is high enough, you can understand what animals and monsters are saying.<br><br>The story of Magium starts at the beginning of the tournament, right after you and all the other participants were transported to the continent where the contest was taking place, and it is set in a medieval fantasy setting, with a dash of futuristic looking magical devices, which are relics of an ancient, technologically advanced civilization that crumbled hundreds of years before the beginning of the series. The world in which the story takes place is somewhat inspired from Dungeons and Dragons, so if you&#39;ve played DnD before, you will likely find some similarities, especially regarding the magic system.<br><br>As the story progresses, you will meet with other participants, you will make friends and enemies, and you will find out more about the continent you are on, and its inhabitants. You will find out that a person called &quot;The Creator&quot; had established several utopias in this place, six hundred years ago, where animals and humans lived in harmony, and food was created through magic. What you will get to see, however, is the downfall of these utopias, some of them being on the brink of destruction. Your choices will influence what happens in these cities, and you can even choose to save them if you so desire.<br><br>The game will be divided into six or seven books, each of them consisting of more than a hundred thousand words.<br><br>The first book is now available in its entirety, and it can be played for free. It is approximately 178k words long, which translates to about 700 book pages. This number also takes into account the story&#39;s branching paths. The length of a playthrough on average should be about 90k words, so about 350 book pages.<br><br>The second book is now available in its entirety, but the next books have not been written yet, and they will be published chapter by chapter, as I write them. Unlike the first book, the second one will need to be unlocked before it can be played, and it will be the same for the next books as well. In order to unlock the second book, you will either need to complete 25 of the 35 available achievements, or pay to unlock it. All of the next books will also be unlockable in the same way.<br><br>The second book is 277k words in total, on all paths, which translates to about 1100 book pages. On one path, you should be seeing around half of those words, so roughly 140k, which would translate to 550 book pages or so.  <br><br>If you want to be notified about the game&#39;s updates, you can follow Magium Games on twitter by following this link: https://twitter.com/Magium_games or if you prefer to use Facebook for your updates, you can also follow the game&#39;s Facebook page at this link: https://www.facebook.com/Magium-Games-1933559536878087/<br><br>Credits for the game icon go to Agnes Landgraf.",

    "descriptionHtml": "<b>Disclaimer: The game is only available in English.</b><br><br>Magium is a DnD inspired text adventure game similar to old Choose your own story books (CYOA), in which you play as an ordinary guy named Barry, who joins a deadly mage tournament against the most powerful mages in the world in the hopes of using the prize to fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a mage himself.<br><br>As in all interactive novels, your choices will affect the story, and making wrong choices can even lead to your death. Besides the traditional choice making of regular Choose your own path games, Magium also has stats that you can upgrade with points that you will receive occasionally, throughout the game. These stats will be checked by the game from time to time, to see if they are high enough to allow you to perform certain actions. For example, if your ancient languages stat is high enough, you can understand what animals and monsters are saying.<br><br>The story of Magium starts at the beginning of the tournament, right after you and all the other participants were transported to the continent where the contest was taking place, and it is set in a medieval fantasy setting, with a dash of futuristic looking magical devices, which are relics of an ancient, technologically advanced civilization that crumbled hundreds of years before the beginning of the series. The world in which the story takes place is somewhat inspired from Dungeons and Dragons, so if you&#39;ve played DnD before, you will likely find some similarities, especially regarding the magic system.<br><br>As the story progresses, you will meet with other participants, you will make friends and enemies, and you will find out more about the continent you are on, and its inhabitants. You will find out that a person called &quot;The Creator&quot; had established several utopias in this place, six hundred years ago, where animals and humans lived in harmony, and food was created through magic. What you will get to see, however, is the downfall of these utopias, some of them being on the brink of destruction. Your choices will influence what happens in these cities, and you can even choose to save them if you so desire.<br><br>The game will be divided into six or seven books, each of them consisting of more than a hundred thousand words.<br><br>The first book is now available in its entirety, and it can be played for free. It is approximately 178k words long, which translates to about 700 book pages. This number also takes into account the story&#39;s branching paths. The length of a playthrough on average should be about 90k words, so about 350 book pages.<br><br>The second book is now available in its entirety, but the next books have not been written yet, and they will be published chapter by chapter, as I write them. Unlike the first book, the second one will need to be unlocked before it can be played, and it will be the same for the next books as well. In order to unlock the second book, you will either need to complete 25 of the 35 available achievements, or pay to unlock it. All of the next books will also be unlockable in the same way.<br><br>The second book is 277k words in total, on all paths, which translates to about 1100 book pages. On one path, you should be seeing around half of those words, so roughly 140k, which would translate to 550 book pages or so.  <br><br>If you want to be notified about the game&#39;s updates, you can follow Magium Games on twitter by following this link: https://twitter.com/Magium_games or if you prefer to use Facebook for your updates, you can also follow the game&#39;s Facebook page at this link: https://www.facebook.com/Magium-Games-1933559536878087/<br><br>Credits for the game icon go to Agnes Landgraf.",

    "descriptionHtml": "<b>Disclaimer: The game is only available in English.</b><br><br>Magium is a DnD inspired text adventure game similar to old Choose your own story books (CYOA), in which you play as an ordinary guy named Barry, who joins a deadly mage tournament against the most powerful mages in the world in the hopes of using the prize to fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a mage himself.<br><br>As in all interactive novels, your choices will affect the story, and making wrong choices can even lead to your death. Besides the traditional choice making of regular Choose your own path games, Magium also has stats that you can upgrade with points that you will receive occasionally, throughout the game. These stats will be checked by the game from time to time, to see if they are high enough to allow you to perform certain actions. For example, if your ancient languages stat is high enough, you can understand what animals and monsters are saying.<br><br>The story of Magium starts at the beginning of the tournament, right after you and all the other participants were transported to the continent where the contest was taking place, and it is set in a medieval fantasy setting, with a dash of futuristic looking magical devices, which are relics of an ancient, technologically advanced civilization that crumbled hundreds of years before the beginning of the series. The world in which the story takes place is somewhat inspired from Dungeons and Dragons, so if you&#39;ve played DnD before, you will likely find some similarities, especially regarding the magic system.<br><br>As the story progresses, you will meet with other participants, you will make friends and enemies, and you will find out more about the continent you are on, and its inhabitants. You will find out that a person called &quot;The Creator&quot; had established several utopias in this place, six hundred years ago, where animals and humans lived in harmony, and food was created through magic. What you will get to see, however, is the downfall of these utopias, some of them being on the brink of destruction. Your choices will influence what happens in these cities, and you can even choose to save them if you so desire.<br><br>The game will be divided into six or seven books, each of them consisting of more than a hundred thousand words.<br><br>The first book is now available in its entirety, and it can be played for free. It is approximately 178k words long, which translates to about 700 book pages. This number also takes into account the story&#39;s branching paths. The length of a playthrough on average should be about 90k words, so about 350 book pages.<br><br>The second book is now available in its entirety, but the next books have not been written yet, and they will be published chapter by chapter, as I write them. Unlike the first book, the second one will need to be unlocked before it can be played, and it will be the same for the next books as well. In order to unlock the second book, you will either need to complete 25 of the 35 available achievements, or pay to unlock it. All of the next books will also be unlockable in the same way.<br><br>The second book is 277k words in total, on all paths, which translates to about 1100 book pages. On one path, you should be seeing around half of those words, so roughly 140k, which would translate to 550 book pages or so.  <br><br>If you want to be notified about the game&#39;s updates, you can follow Magium Games on twitter by following this link: https://twitter.com/Magium_games or if you prefer to use Facebook for your updates, you can also follow the game&#39;s Facebook page at this link: https://www.facebook.com/Magium-Games-1933559536878087/<br><br>Credits for the game icon go to Agnes Landgraf.",

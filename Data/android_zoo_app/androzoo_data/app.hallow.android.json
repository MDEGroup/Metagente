    "descriptionHtml": "Hallow is a prayer app that offers guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith lives and find peace &amp; stillness in God. Explore contemplative prayer &amp; meditation sessions across techniques like:<br>* Christian Meditation: finding peace in silence, imaginative prayer and recollection. This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in that we\u2019re learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is that the goal of prayer with Hallow is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts and minds up to God, to talk with Him, to listen to Him, and to recognize His presence with us<br>* Examen: reflecting on your day and discovering an awareness of God, Jesus, &amp; the Holy Spirit in the present moment<br>* Lectio Divina: entering into a conversation with God through passages from the Bible<br>* Spiritual Writing: journaling with God<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Chant Meditation: meditative chant &amp; singing<br>* Rosary: meditating with Mary through the mysteries of the Rosary<br>The world is stressful, hectic, &amp; full of distractions. It puts an insane amount of pressure on us to work harder, study more, respond faster, &amp; perform better. At the same time, we\u2019re all searching for meaning, fulfillment, purpose, and deeper spiritual lives. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: deepening our relationship with Christ and growing in His peace, joy &amp; fulfillment.

    "descriptionHtml": "Hallow is a prayer app that offers guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith lives and find peace &amp; stillness in God. Explore contemplative prayer &amp; meditation sessions across techniques like:<br>* Christian Meditation: finding peace in silence, imaginative prayer and recollection. This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in that we\u2019re learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is that the goal of prayer with Hallow is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts and minds up to God, to talk with Him, to listen to Him, and to recognize His presence with us<br>* Examen: reflecting on your day and discovering an awareness of God, Jesus, &amp; the Holy Spirit in the present moment<br>* Lectio Divina: entering into a conversation with God through passages from the Bible<br>* Spiritual Writing: journaling with God<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Chant Meditation: meditative chant &amp; singing<br>* Rosary: meditating with Mary through the mysteries of the Rosary<br>The world is stressful, hectic, &amp; full of distractions. It puts an insane amount of pressure on us to work harder, study more, respond faster, &amp; perform better. At the same time, we\u2019re all searching for meaning, fulfillment, purpose, and deeper spiritual lives. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: deepening our relationship with Christ and growing in His peace, joy &amp; fulfillment. In the end, a halo &amp; heaven is the goal :)<br>WHAT YOU GET<br>Hallow\u2019s intuitive, convenient &amp; personalized experience begins with a 9-day intro that guides you step-by-step through 3 different methods of prayer. After this, it\u2019s up to you to choose from our collection of over 500 sessions across 5 different sections:<br>*Dailies: Daily prayers across methods including Lectio Divina (on the Daily Gospel), the Rosary, Spiritual Writing, &amp; the Examen.<br>*Praylists: Sessions across a variety of prayer methods, all centered on one particular theme, e.g., joy, humility, making decisions, calm, letting go.<br>*Challenges: Prayers usually focused on re-discovering the beauty within traditional prayers, e.g., the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, and Psalms.<br>*Community: Prayers with a set schedule to pray along with the rest of the Hallow community, such as the #pray40 Lenten Challenge, which begins on Ash Wednesday and continues throughout all of Lent.<br>*Sleep: Prayers designed specifically to help you prepare to sleep, including Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Divine Office, and nightly Examens.<br>Additionally, Hallow offers a number of features to help users customize their prayer experience:<br>* Journal for users to capture their thoughts after every prayer<br>* Choice of male or female guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music in any session<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>As Hallow is a Catholic app, all of our content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors).<br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our Daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Praylists and Challenges, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br>These prices are for United States customers.<br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

Explore contemplative prayer &amp; meditation sessions across techniques like:<br>* Christian Meditation: finding peace in silence, imaginative prayer and recollection. This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in that we\u2019re learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is that the goal of prayer with Hallow is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts and minds up to God, to talk with Him, to listen to Him, and to recognize His presence with us<br>* Examen: reflecting on your day and discovering an awareness of God, Jesus, &amp; the Holy Spirit in the present moment<br>* Lectio Divina: entering into a conversation with God through passages from the Bible<br>* Spiritual Writing: journaling with God<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Chant Meditation: meditative chant &amp; singing<br>* Rosary: meditating with Mary through the mysteries of the Rosary<br>The world is stressful, hectic, &amp; full of distractions. It puts an insane amount of pressure on us to work harder, study more, respond faster, &amp; perform better.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayer: Pray daily across methods including Lectio Divina (on the Daily Gospel), the Rosary, or Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Catholic Bible Sleep Stories: Prayers to help you fall asleep, Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Divine Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz<br>* Rosary: Meditating with Mary through the mysteries of the Rosary<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Try out the #pray40 Lenten Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics like being a Catholic Dad, on St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - get started with Hallow\u2019s Intro 9 Day Novena challenge<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54-day Novena, and more like the St. Joseph Novena coming soon!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Hallow also offers a number of features to help you customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal for users to capture their thoughts after every prayer<br>* Choice of male or female guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant in any session<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>The content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and Catholic women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Read more about our terms and conditions here: https://hallow.com/terms-of-service<br>Read more about our privacy policy here: https://hallow.com/privacy-policy",

Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep.

In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayer: Pray daily across methods including Lectio Divina (on the Daily Gospel), the Rosary, or Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Catholic Bible Sleep Stories: Prayers to help you fall asleep, Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Divine Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr.

While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and Catholic women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayer: Pray daily across methods including Lectio Divina (on the Daily Gospel), the Rosary, or Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Catholic Bible Sleep Stories: Prayers to help you fall asleep, Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Divine Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz<br>* Rosary: Meditating with Mary through the mysteries of the Rosary<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Try out the #pray40 Lenten Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics like being a Catholic Dad, on St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - get started with Hallow\u2019s Intro 9 Day Novena challenge<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54-day Novena, and more like the St. Joseph Novena coming soon!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Hallow also offers a number of features to help you customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal for users to capture their thoughts after every prayer<br>* Choice of male or female guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant in any session<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>The content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and Catholic women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayer: Pray daily across methods including Lectio Divina (on the Daily Gospel), the Rosary, or Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Catholic Bible Sleep Stories: Prayers to help you fall asleep, Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Divine Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz<br>* Rosary: Meditating with Mary through the mysteries of the Rosary<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Try out the #pray40 Lenten Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics like being a Catholic Dad, on St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - get started with Hallow\u2019s Intro 9 Day Novena challenge<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54-day Novena, and more like the St. Joseph Novena coming soon!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Hallow also offers a number of features to help you customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal for users to capture their thoughts after every prayer<br>* Choice of male or female guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant in any session<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>The content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and Catholic women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Read more about our terms and conditions here: https://hallow.com/terms-of-service<br>Read more about our privacy policy here: https://hallow.com/privacy-policy",

At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayer: Pray daily across methods including Lectio Divina (on the Daily Gospel), the Rosary, or Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Catholic Bible Sleep Stories: Prayers to help you fall asleep, Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Divine Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz<br>* Rosary: Meditating with Mary through the mysteries of the Rosary<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Try out the #pray40 Lenten Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics like being a Catholic Dad, on St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - get started with Hallow\u2019s Intro 9 Day Novena challenge<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54-day Novena, and more like the St. Joseph Novena coming soon!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Hallow also offers a number of features to help you customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal for users to capture their thoughts after every prayer<br>* Choice of male or female guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant in any session<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>The content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and Catholic women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Bible Sleep Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Bible Sleep Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Bible Sleep Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Bible Sleep Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Bible Sleep Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Bible Sleep Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep.

We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

    "descriptionHtml": "** The #1 Catholic App **<br><br>WHAT IS HALLOW<br>Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith &amp; spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 500 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, &amp; relationship. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, &amp; the Divine Mercy Chaplet<br>* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, &amp; recognize His presence with us<br>* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible<br>* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals<br>* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day &amp; discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, &amp; the Holy Spirit<br>* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture<br>* Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant &amp; music<br>* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>* Homilies &amp; Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine &amp; more!<br>* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm<br>* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena<br>* Litanies &amp; Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!<br>* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!<br><br>Additional features to help customize your prayer experience:<br>* Journal after every prayer<br>* Choice of man or woman guide<br>* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>* Ability to set prayer reminders<br>* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant<br>* Ability to download sessions for offline listening<br>* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD\u2019s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.<br>Terms and conditions: https://hallow.app/terms-of-service<br>Privacy policy: https://hallow.app/privacy-policy",

Explore over 1,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 1,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 3,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, &amp; can\u2019t sleep.

We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths &amp; religions.<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br>Users can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.<br>To access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:<br>$8.99 per month<br>$59.99 per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.<br><br>Your Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

Explore over 1,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 1,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 1,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Mike Schmitz, Bishop Barron, and more on topics like being a Catholic Dad, family &amp; more!<br>\u2022 Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, stress reduction, and calm sleep meditations<br>\u2022 Personal Prayer Journal: Pray, meditate &amp; document your spiritual journey<br>\u2022 Challenges: Join thousands of Catholics and Christians in a community of prayer such as Easter Prayers, Divine Mercy Chaplet, or 54-Day Rosary Novena.<br>\u2022 Litanies, Novenas, &amp; Devotionals: Try the Litany of Humility, the Surrender Novena &amp; more!<br>\u2022 Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You; Angelus; Holy Rosary Decade; St. Michael the Archangel prayer &amp; more!<br><br>Additional features to customize your prayer experience:<br>\u2022 3 different length options for each prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>\u2022 Set prayer reminders to pray and journal<br>\u2022 Include calm background music like Gregorian chant<br>\u2022 Download &amp; listen offline<br>\u2022 Join a Hallow Family to share prayers, intentions, and journal reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology &amp; spirituality guides, reviewed by senior leaders within the Catholic Church (e.g., PhDs, professors, Bishops, authors), and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible.

Explore over 1,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 1,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Mike Schmitz, Bishop Barron, and more on topics like being a Catholic Dad, family &amp; more!<br>\u2022 Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, stress reduction, and calm sleep meditations<br>\u2022 Personal Prayer Journal: Pray, meditate &amp; document your spiritual journey<br>\u2022 Challenges: Join thousands of Catholics and Christians in a community of prayer such as Easter Prayers, Divine Mercy Chaplet, or 54-Day Rosary Novena.<br>\u2022 Litanies, Novenas, &amp; Devotionals: Try the Litany of Humility, the Surrender Novena &amp; more!<br>\u2022 Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You; Angelus; Holy Rosary Decade; St. Michael the Archangel prayer &amp; more!<br><br>Additional features to customize your prayer experience:<br>\u2022 3 different length options for each prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>\u2022 Set prayer reminders to pray and journal<br>\u2022 Include calm background music like Gregorian chant<br>\u2022 Download &amp; listen offline<br>\u2022 Join a Hallow Family to share prayers, intentions, and journal reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology &amp; spirituality guides, reviewed by senior leaders within the Catholic Church (e.g., PhDs, professors, Bishops, authors), and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible.

Explore over 6,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 6,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 6,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 6,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Mike Schmitz, Bishop Barron, and more on topics like being a Catholic Dad, family &amp; more!<br>\u2022 Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, stress reduction, and calm sleep meditations<br>\u2022 Personal Prayer Journal: Pray, meditate &amp; document your spiritual journey<br>\u2022 Challenges: Join thousands of Catholics and Christians in a community of prayer such as Easter Prayers, Divine Mercy Chaplet, or 54-Day Rosary Novena.<br>\u2022 Litanies, Novenas, &amp; Devotionals: Try the Litany of Humility, the Surrender Novena &amp; more!<br>\u2022 Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You; Angelus; Holy Rosary Decade; St. Michael the Archangel prayer &amp; more!<br><br>Additional features to customize your prayer experience:<br>\u2022 3 different length options for each prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>\u2022 Set prayer reminders to pray and journal<br>\u2022 Include calm background music like Gregorian chant<br>\u2022 Download &amp; listen offline<br>\u2022 Join a Hallow Family to share prayers, intentions, and journal reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App, the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology &amp; spirituality guides, reviewed by senior leaders within the Catholic Church (e.g., PhDs, professors, Bishops, authors), and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible.

Explore over 6,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived. At the same time, we\u2019re searching for deeper meaning, purpose &amp; relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in Heaven is the goal :)<br><br>WHAT YOU GET<br>\u2022 Daily Prayers &amp; Devotionals: Pray daily across methods, including 3 of our most popular \u2013 Lectio Divina (in Daily Readings), the Holy Rosary, the Divine Mercy Chaplet, or Daily Mass Readings and Reflections.<br>\u2022 Christian Meditation: Similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence. But in Christian meditation, the goal is never to remain in ourselves, always to lift our hearts &amp; minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, and recognize His presence with us<br>\u2022 Bible Stories for Sleep: Try sounds of the Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours/Daily Office and Catholic Holy Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from The Chosen or Father Mike Schmitz from The Bible in a Year podcast <br>\u2022 Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other daily devotionals and prayers.<br>\u2022 Ignatian Examen: Reflect &amp; meditate on your day and find an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit<br>\u2022 Lectio Divina: Converse with God through passages/Scripture from the Holy Bible<br>\u2022 Taiz\u00e9 &amp; Gregorian Chant: Calm, meditative chants, Christian music &amp; sleep sounds<br>\u2022 Community: Join the #Pray40 Lent Challenge from Ash Wednesday to Easter, or our #Pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas<br>\u2022 Homilies &amp; Guests: From Fr. Mike Schmitz, Bishop Barron, and more on topics like being a Catholic Dad, family &amp; more!<br>\u2022 Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, stress reduction, and calm sleep meditations<br>\u2022 Personal Prayer Journal: Pray, meditate &amp; document your spiritual journey<br>\u2022 Challenges: Join thousands of Catholics and Christians in a community of prayer such as Easter Prayers, Divine Mercy Chaplet, or 54-Day Rosary Novena.<br>\u2022 Litanies, Novenas, &amp; Devotionals: Try the Litany of Humility, the Surrender Novena &amp; more!<br>\u2022 Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You; Angelus; Holy Rosary Decade; St. Michael the Archangel prayer &amp; more!<br><br>Additional features to customize your prayer experience:<br>\u2022 3 different length options for each prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)<br>\u2022 Set prayer reminders to pray and journal<br>\u2022 Include calm background music like Gregorian chant<br>\u2022 Download &amp; listen offline<br>\u2022 Join a Hallow Family to share prayers, intentions, and journal reflections with one another<br><br>As Hallow is a Catholic App, the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology &amp; spirituality guides, reviewed by senior leaders within the Catholic Church (e.g., PhDs, professors, Bishops, authors), and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible.

Explore over 10,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 10,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 10,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 10,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 10,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 10,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 10,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 10,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 10,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 10,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 10,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

Explore over 10,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.<br><br>In today\u2019s world, we\u2019re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived.

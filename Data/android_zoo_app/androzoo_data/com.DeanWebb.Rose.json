Well now you can with Rose! You can even choose whether or not you want to use English, Pinyin or Characters when learning, the amount of questions that you will be asked, and the amount of options that you will have to choose from, allowing for you to adjust the difficult to best fit you!<br><br>Learning can be difficult sometimes without the right motivation. That is why Rose comes with a world for you to care for! By using the points that you earn whilst you learn, you will be able to grow and care for your bears.

Want to have a fun learning experience that can you heavily customise to suit your own needs?

That is why Rose has been specifically crafted to deal with the challenges that come with learning the language, in order to give you the best environment to work with!<br><br>Everyone learns in different ways, so you will need plenty of different options to choose from. Whether you like to match English to Chinese or choose from a selection of options to test your memory, build words and phrases using components to further help you understand meaning behind words, or type out some Pinyin to get the right tone. Here you can do it all and more, either separately, all together, or as a mix, so that you will never forget again!<br><br>If you think there is not enough game modes for you, do not worry. Maybe you want to play a competitive game with your family or friends, or you wish to gamify your learning experience with whole new game modes that will allow for you to learn whilst are playing a game. Well with Rose you can! By earning points as you learn, or by spending real world currency, you will be able to choose from a large selection of game modes that will keep you busy and entertained as you challenge yourself to further improve your skills!<br><br>But learning is not all that is important, you also want to be able to track your learning. By being able to see what your strongest and weakest words and phrases are, you will be able to customise your learning so that you can practice and improve on these, allowing for you to perfect your skills. You can also see other details, including how much you have got correct and how many minutes you have spent learning, for any given day, allowing you to set your own goals that will best suit you!<br><br>However, in order to get the best learning experience for yourself, you will need for it to be perfect for you. Perhaps there are categories that you do not need to learn, or you want to focus on a certain list of words and phrases, such as new ones that you have not learnt yet, or a list that you have formed for yourself. Well now you can with Rose! You can even choose whether or not you want to use English, Pinyin or Characters when learning, the amount of questions that you will be asked, and the amount of options that you will have to choose from, allowing for you to adjust the difficult to best fit you!<br><br>Learning can be difficult sometimes without the right motivation. That is why Rose comes with a world for you to care for! By using the points that you earn whilst you learn, you will be able to grow and care for your bears. They will need water to drink, food to eat and places to sleep. In an ever expanding world, there will always be things for you to check back up on and for you to spend your points on, motivating you to learn more!<br><br>With Rose, you can learn wherever and whenever you want, with no internet being required. So why not give Rose a try today and become the master of your own learning!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Want to learn how to speak, read and write in Chinese, the most spoken language in the world? Want to improve and hone in on your skills to help progress your learning? Want to have a fun learning experience that can you heavily customise to suit your own needs? Well with Rose you have have all of that!<br><br>Chinese can be one of the most challenging languages to learn, needing a lot of commitment and plenty of revision in order to become an expert at it. That is why Rose has been specifically crafted to deal with the challenges that come with learning the language, in order to give you the best environment to work with!<br><br>Everyone learns in different ways, so you will need plenty of different options to choose from. Whether you like to match English to Chinese or choose from a selection of options to test your memory, build words and phrases using components to further help you understand meaning behind words, or type out some Pinyin to get the right tone. Here you can do it all and more, either separately, all together, or as a mix, so that you will never forget again!<br><br>If you think there is not enough game modes for you, do not worry. Maybe you want to play a competitive game with your family or friends, or you wish to gamify your learning experience with whole new game modes that will allow for you to learn whilst are playing a game. Well with Rose you can! By earning points as you learn, or by spending real world currency, you will be able to choose from a large selection of game modes that will keep you busy and entertained as you challenge yourself to further improve your skills!<br><br>But learning is not all that is important, you also want to be able to track your learning. By being able to see what your strongest and weakest words and phrases are, you will be able to customise your learning so that you can practice and improve on these, allowing for you to perfect your skills. You can also see other details, including how much you have got correct and how many minutes you have spent learning, for any given day, allowing you to set your own goals that will best suit you!<br><br>However, in order to get the best learning experience for yourself, you will need for it to be perfect for you. Perhaps there are categories that you do not need to learn, or you want to focus on a certain list of words and phrases, such as new ones that you have not learnt yet, or a list that you have formed for yourself. Well now you can with Rose! You can even choose whether or not you want to use English, Pinyin or Characters when learning, the amount of questions that you will be asked, and the amount of options that you will have to choose from, allowing for you to adjust the difficult to best fit you!<br><br>Learning can be difficult sometimes without the right motivation. That is why Rose comes with a world for you to care for! By using the points that you earn whilst you learn, you will be able to grow and care for your bears. They will need water to drink, food to eat and places to sleep. In an ever expanding world, there will always be things for you to check back up on and for you to spend your points on, motivating you to learn more!<br><br>With Rose, you can learn wherever and whenever you want, with no internet being required. So why not give Rose a try today and become the master of your own learning!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Want to learn how to speak, read and write in Chinese, the most spoken language in the world? Want to improve and hone in on your skills to help progress your learning? Want to have a fun learning experience that can you heavily customise to suit your own needs? Well with Rose you have have all of that!<br><br>Chinese can be one of the most challenging languages to learn, needing a lot of commitment and plenty of revision in order to become an expert at it. That is why Rose has been specifically crafted to deal with the challenges that come with learning the language, in order to give you the best environment to work with!<br><br>Everyone learns in different ways, so you will need plenty of different options to choose from. Whether you like to match English to Chinese or choose from a selection of options to test your memory, build words and phrases using components to further help you understand meaning behind words, or type out some Pinyin to get the right tone. Here you can do it all and more, either separately, all together, or as a mix, so that you will never forget again!<br><br>If you think there is not enough game modes for you, do not worry. Maybe you want to play a competitive game with your family or friends, or you wish to gamify your learning experience with whole new game modes that will allow for you to learn whilst are playing a game. Well with Rose you can! By earning points as you learn, or by spending real world currency, you will be able to choose from a large selection of game modes that will keep you busy and entertained as you challenge yourself to further improve your skills!<br><br>But learning is not all that is important, you also want to be able to track your learning. By being able to see what your strongest and weakest words and phrases are, you will be able to customise your learning so that you can practice and improve on these, allowing for you to perfect your skills. You can also see other details, including how much you have got correct and how many minutes you have spent learning, for any given day, allowing you to set your own goals that will best suit you!<br><br>However, in order to get the best learning experience for yourself, you will need for it to be perfect for you. Perhaps there are categories that you do not need to learn, or you want to focus on a certain list of words and phrases, such as new ones that you have not learnt yet, or a list that you have formed for yourself. Well now you can with Rose! You can even choose whether or not you want to use English, Pinyin or Characters when learning, the amount of questions that you will be asked, and the amount of options that you will have to choose from, allowing for you to adjust the difficult to best fit you!<br><br>Learning can be difficult sometimes without the right motivation. That is why Rose comes with a world for you to care for! By using the points that you earn whilst you learn, you will be able to grow and care for your bears. They will need water to drink, food to eat and places to sleep. In an ever expanding world, there will always be things for you to check back up on and for you to spend your points on, motivating you to learn more!<br><br>With Rose, you can learn wherever and whenever you want, with no internet being required. So why not give Rose a try today and become the master of your own learning!",

Want to have a fun learning experience that can you heavily customise to suit your own needs? Well with Rose you have have all of that!<br><br>Chinese can be one of the most challenging languages to learn, needing a lot of commitment and plenty of revision in order to become an expert at it. That is why Rose has been specifically crafted to deal with the challenges that come with learning the language, in order to give you the best environment to work with!<br><br>Everyone learns in different ways, so you will need plenty of different options to choose from. Whether you like to match English to Chinese or choose from a selection of options to test your memory, build words and phrases using components to further help you understand meaning behind words, or type out some Pinyin to get the right tone. Here you can do it all and more, either separately, all together, or as a mix, so that you will never forget again!<br><br>If you think there is not enough game modes for you, do not worry. Maybe you want to play a competitive game with your family or friends, or you wish to gamify your learning experience with whole new game modes that will allow for you to learn whilst are playing a game. Well with Rose you can! By earning points as you learn, or by spending real world currency, you will be able to choose from a large selection of game modes that will keep you busy and entertained as you challenge yourself to further improve your skills!<br><br>But learning is not all that is important, you also want to be able to track your learning. By being able to see what your strongest and weakest words and phrases are, you will be able to customise your learning so that you can practice and improve on these, allowing for you to perfect your skills. You can also see other details, including how much you have got correct and how many minutes you have spent learning, for any given day, allowing you to set your own goals that will best suit you!<br><br>However, in order to get the best learning experience for yourself, you will need for it to be perfect for you. Perhaps there are categories that you do not need to learn, or you want to focus on a certain list of words and phrases, such as new ones that you have not learnt yet, or a list that you have formed for yourself. Well now you can with Rose! You can even choose whether or not you want to use English, Pinyin or Characters when learning, the amount of questions that you will be asked, and the amount of options that you will have to choose from, allowing for you to adjust the difficult to best fit you!<br><br>Learning can be difficult sometimes without the right motivation. That is why Rose comes with a world for you to care for! By using the points that you earn whilst you learn, you will be able to grow and care for your bears. They will need water to drink, food to eat and places to sleep. In an ever expanding world, there will always be things for you to check back up on and for you to spend your points on, motivating you to learn more!<br><br>With Rose, you can learn wherever and whenever you want, with no internet being required. So why not give Rose a try today and become the master of your own learning!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Want to learn how to speak, read and write in Chinese, the most spoken language in the world? Want to improve and hone in on your skills to help progress your learning? Want to have a fun learning experience that can you heavily customise to suit your own needs? Well with Rose you have have all of that!<br><br>Chinese can be one of the most challenging languages to learn, needing a lot of commitment and plenty of revision in order to become an expert at it. That is why Rose has been specifically crafted to deal with the challenges that come with learning the language, in order to give you the best environment to work with!<br><br>Everyone learns in different ways, so you will need plenty of different options to choose from. Whether you like to match English to Chinese or choose from a selection of options to test your memory, build words and phrases using components to further help you understand meaning behind words, or type out some Pinyin to get the right tone. Here you can do it all and more, either separately, all together, or as a mix, so that you will never forget again!<br><br>If you think there is not enough game modes for you, do not worry. Maybe you want to play a competitive game with your family or friends, or you wish to gamify your learning experience with whole new game modes that will allow for you to learn whilst are playing a game. Well with Rose you can! By earning points as you learn, or by spending real world currency, you will be able to choose from a large selection of game modes that will keep you busy and entertained as you challenge yourself to further improve your skills!<br><br>But learning is not all that is important, you also want to be able to track your learning. By being able to see what your strongest and weakest words and phrases are, you will be able to customise your learning so that you can practice and improve on these, allowing for you to perfect your skills. You can also see other details, including how much you have got correct and how many minutes you have spent learning, for any given day, allowing you to set your own goals that will best suit you!<br><br>However, in order to get the best learning experience for yourself, you will need for it to be perfect for you. Perhaps there are categories that you do not need to learn, or you want to focus on a certain list of words and phrases, such as new ones that you have not learnt yet, or a list that you have formed for yourself. Well now you can with Rose! You can even choose whether or not you want to use English, Pinyin or Characters when learning, the amount of questions that you will be asked, and the amount of options that you will have to choose from, allowing for you to adjust the difficult to best fit you!<br><br>Learning can be difficult sometimes without the right motivation. That is why Rose comes with a world for you to care for! By using the points that you earn whilst you learn, you will be able to grow and care for your bears. They will need water to drink, food to eat and places to sleep. In an ever expanding world, there will always be things for you to check back up on and for you to spend your points on, motivating you to learn more!<br><br>With Rose, you can learn wherever and whenever you want, with no internet being required. So why not give Rose a try today and become the master of your own learning!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Want to learn how to speak, read and write in both Simplified and Traditional Chinese? Want to improve and hone in on your skills to help progress your learning? Want to have a fun learning experience that you can heavily customise to suit your own needs? Well with Rose you have all of that!<br><br>Chinese can be one of the most challenging languages to learn, needing a lot of commitment and plenty of revision in order to become an expert at it. That is why Rose has been specifically crafted to deal with the challenges that come with learning the language, in order to give you the best environment to work with!<br><br>Everyone learns in different ways, so you will need plenty of different options to choose from. Whether you like to match English to Chinese or choose from a selection of options to test your memory, build words and phrases using components to further help you understand meaning behind words, or type out some Pinyin to get the right tone. Here you can do it all and more, either separately, all together, or as a mix, so that you will never forget again!<br><br>If you think there are not enough game modes for you, do not worry. Maybe you want to play a competitive game with your family or friends, or you wish to gamify your learning experience with whole new game modes that will allow for you to learn whilst are playing a game. Well with Rose you can! By earning points as you learn, or by spending real world currency, you will be able to choose from a large selection of game modes that will keep you busy and entertained as you challenge yourself to further improve your skills!<br><br>But learning is not all that is important, you also want to be able to track your learning. By being able to see what your strongest and weakest words and phrases are, you will be able to customise your learning so that you can practice and improve on these, allowing for you to perfect your skills. You can also see other details, including how much you have got correct and how many minutes you have spent learning, for any given day, allowing you to set your own goals that will best suit you!<br><br>However, in order to get the best learning experience for yourself, you will need it to be perfect for you. Perhaps there are categories that you do not need to learn, or you want to focus on a certain list of words and phrases, such as new ones that you have not learnt yet, or a list that you have formed for yourself. Well now you can with Rose! You can even choose whether or not you want to use English, Pinyin or Hanzi when learning, the amount of questions that you will be asked, and the amount of options that you will have to choose from, allowing for you to adjust the difficulty to best fit you!<br><br>Learning can be difficult sometimes without the right motivation. That is why Rose comes with a world for you to care for! By using the points that you earn whilst you learn, you will be able to grow and care for your bears. They will need water to drink, food to eat and places to sleep. In an ever expanding world, there will always be things for you to check back up on and for you to spend your points on, motivating you to learn more!<br><br>With Rose, you can learn wherever and whenever you want, with no internet and subscriptions being required. So why not give Rose a try today and become the master of your own learning!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Want to learn how to speak, read and write in both Simplified and Traditional Chinese? Want to improve and hone in on your skills to help progress your learning? Want to have a fun learning experience that you can heavily customise to suit your own needs? Well with Rose you have all of that!<br><br>Chinese can be one of the most challenging languages to learn, needing a lot of commitment and plenty of revision in order to become an expert at it. That is why Rose has been specifically crafted to deal with the challenges that come with learning the language, in order to give you the best environment to work with!<br><br>Everyone learns in different ways, so you will need plenty of different options to choose from. Whether you like to match English to Chinese or choose from a selection of options to test your memory, build words and phrases using components to further help you understand meaning behind words, or type out some Pinyin to get the right tone. Here you can do it all and more, either separately, all together, or as a mix, so that you will never forget again!<br><br>If you think there are not enough game modes for you, do not worry. Maybe you want to play a competitive game with your family or friends, or you wish to gamify your learning experience with whole new game modes that will allow for you to learn whilst are playing a game. Well with Rose you can! By earning points as you learn, or by spending real world currency, you will be able to choose from a large selection of game modes that will keep you busy and entertained as you challenge yourself to further improve your skills!<br><br>But learning is not all that is important, you also want to be able to track your learning. By being able to see what your strongest and weakest words and phrases are, you will be able to customise your learning so that you can practice and improve on these, allowing for you to perfect your skills. You can also see other details, including how much you have got correct and how many minutes you have spent learning, for any given day, allowing you to set your own goals that will best suit you!<br><br>However, in order to get the best learning experience for yourself, you will need it to be perfect for you. Perhaps there are categories that you do not need to learn, or you want to focus on a certain list of words and phrases, such as new ones that you have not learnt yet, or a list that you have formed for yourself. Well now you can with Rose! You can even choose whether or not you want to use English, Pinyin or Hanzi when learning, the amount of questions that you will be asked, and the amount of options that you will have to choose from, allowing for you to adjust the difficulty to best fit you!<br><br>Learning can be difficult sometimes without the right motivation. That is why Rose comes with a world for you to care for! By using the points that you earn whilst you learn, you will be able to grow and care for your bears. They will need water to drink, food to eat and places to sleep. In an ever expanding world, there will always be things for you to check back up on and for you to spend your points on, motivating you to learn more!<br><br>With Rose, you can learn wherever and whenever you want, with no internet and subscriptions being required. So why not give Rose a try today and become the master of your own learning!",

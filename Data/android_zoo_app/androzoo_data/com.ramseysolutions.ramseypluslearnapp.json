With interactive tracking features, you\u2019ll save money (and watch your confidence grow along with your bank account). And as you pay off debt, your stress level goes with it. (Good riddance.) <br><br>In fact, in the first 90 days of working our plan, the average household pays off $5,300 in debt and saves $2,700.

They\u2019re catered to you. Your life. Your goals. That\u2019s what makes this plan work.<br><br>And how will you know the plan is working? Tracking. Your. Progress. With interactive tracking features, you\u2019ll save money (and watch your confidence grow along with your bank account). And as you pay off debt, your stress level goes with it. (Good riddance.) <br><br>In fact, in the first 90 days of working our plan, the average household pays off $5,300 in debt and saves $2,700.

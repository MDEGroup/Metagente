    "descriptionHtml": "Faithful Counseling provides affordable access to high-quality mental healthcare from dedicated Christians. We bring therapy into your life on your terms through direct messaging, phone, and video chats with licensed professionals.<br><br>-------------------------------------------<br><b>FAITHFUL COUNSELING \u2013 FEATURES</b><br>-------------------------------------------<br>Expert counseling from a practicing Christian therapist<br>Find spiritual healing whether you\u2019re Catholic, Protestant, Baptist, or any other denomination of Christianity<br>Get closer to Christ through Christian counseling based on teachings from the bible<br>Speak with therapists with a religious background<br>Seek guidance from spiritual advisors from within the church<br><br><b>FAITH-BASED COUNSELING, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU</b><br>By combining Biblical wisdom with clinical expertise in mental health, our counselors invite God into the conversation through prayer while formulating actionable plans to best address the unique challenges their clients face. Our goal is to holistically improve clients\u2019 well-being, so that they may become mentally, emotionally, and spiritually well.<br><br><b>WHO ARE THE COUNSELORS?</b><br>The thousands of counselors of Faithful Counseling are a group of practicing Christians that provide therapy online.<br>All counselors are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (PhD / PsyD), marriage and family therapists (LMFT), clinical social workers (LCSW / LMSW), or licensed professional counselors (LPC). All have a Masters or Doctorate Degree in their field. They have been qualified and certified by their state&#39;s professional board after successfully completing the necessary education, exams, training, and practice. While their experience, expertise, and background vary, they all possess at least 3 years and 2,000 hours of experience.<br>Additionally, every counselor has self-identified as a practicing Christian, shared their testimony with us prior to joining the platform, and has verified that their beliefs align with our Statement of Faith.<br><br><b>HOW DOES IT WORK?</b><br>You and your counselor will be given a dedicated virtual &quot;room,\u201d which will be your private and secure way of communicating. This room is open 24/7. You can enter it at any time, from any Internet-connected device wherever you are. In this room, you will write about yourself and the things going on in your life, ask questions and discuss the issues that trouble you. Your counselor will log in to the same room, read your messages, and respond with feedback, insights, and guidance. Your counselor will help you understand the circumstances that hold you back as they prepare you to move forward. This ongoing one-on-one dialog is the basis of your work with your counselor. You may also have phone or video based sessions with your counselor, facilitated through this app. Together you will build towards making a positive change in your life and accomplishing your goals.<br><br><b>HOW MANY SESSIONS CAN I HAVE?</b><br>You are not limited in the number of messages (&quot;sessions&quot;) you can have with your counselor. The frequency of your sessions would vary based on your availability, and the interaction between you and your counselor. For example, some people have 3-4 short interactions every week, while others prefer to have one very long and thorough session. Your counselor would try to accommodate your changing needs in a timely manner.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Faithful Counseling provides affordable access to high-quality mental healthcare from dedicated Christians. We bring therapy into your life on your terms through direct messaging, phone, and video chats with licensed professionals.<br><br>-------------------------------------------<br><b>FAITHFUL COUNSELING \u2013 FEATURES</b><br>-------------------------------------------<br>Expert counseling from a practicing Christian therapist<br>Find spiritual healing whether you\u2019re Catholic, Protestant, Baptist, or any other denomination of Christianity<br>Get closer to Christ through Christian counseling based on teachings from the bible<br>Speak with therapists with a religious background<br>Seek guidance from spiritual advisors from within the church<br><br><b>FAITH-BASED COUNSELING, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU</b><br>By combining Biblical wisdom with clinical expertise in mental health, our counselors invite God into the conversation through prayer while formulating actionable plans to best address the unique challenges their clients face. Our goal is to holistically improve clients\u2019 well-being, so that they may become mentally, emotionally, and spiritually well.<br><br><b>WHO ARE THE COUNSELORS?</b><br>The thousands of counselors of Faithful Counseling are a group of practicing Christians that provide therapy online.<br>All counselors are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (PhD / PsyD), marriage and family therapists (LMFT), clinical social workers (LCSW / LMSW), or licensed professional counselors (LPC). All have a Masters or Doctorate Degree in their field. They have been qualified and certified by their state&#39;s professional board after successfully completing the necessary education, exams, training, and practice. While their experience, expertise, and background vary, they all possess at least 3 years and 2,000 hours of experience.<br>Additionally, every counselor has self-identified as a practicing Christian, shared their testimony with us prior to joining the platform, and has verified that their beliefs align with our Statement of Faith.<br><br><b>HOW DOES IT WORK?</b><br>You and your counselor will be given a dedicated virtual &quot;room,\u201d which will be your private and secure way of communicating. This room is open 24/7. You can enter it at any time, from any Internet-connected device wherever you are. In this room, you will write about yourself and the things going on in your life, ask questions and discuss the issues that trouble you. Your counselor will log in to the same room, read your messages, and respond with feedback, insights, and guidance. Your counselor will help you understand the circumstances that hold you back as they prepare you to move forward. This ongoing one-on-one dialog is the basis of your work with your counselor. You may also have phone or video based sessions with your counselor, facilitated through this app. Together you will build towards making a positive change in your life and accomplishing your goals.<br><br><b>HOW MANY SESSIONS CAN I HAVE?</b><br>You are not limited in the number of messages (&quot;sessions&quot;) you can have with your counselor. The frequency of your sessions would vary based on your availability, and the interaction between you and your counselor. For example, some people have 3-4 short interactions every week, while others prefer to have one very long and thorough session. Your counselor would try to accommodate your changing needs in a timely manner.",

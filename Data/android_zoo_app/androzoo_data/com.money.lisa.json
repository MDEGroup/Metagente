    "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever thought about how much you could save by using a water bottle or not buying bottled water, avoiding disposable items or even just bringing a reusable shopping bag with you? How much could we save if we\u2019d stop and think before buying that object that would end up being left unused on a shelf or that shirt we\u2019ll never wear? Not to mention the food gone bad because we were unable to consume it in time. In short, all those actions that we could summarize in one word: waste.<br>\u2028<br>Today more than ever we should pay attention to what we do, in our little we have a great responsibility: if we all start to produce less waste, to use a little less the car and a little more feet, to stop smoking, to recycle what we can or generally have little precautions, we\u2019d do good to the environment that surrounds us and we could benefit from it personally and economically.<br>\u2028<br>MoneyLisa wants to be a stimulus to change our lifestyle. Give it a try: download and use the app to take into account what you have avoided buying or what you have saved thanks to a small action. At first, they may be small figures, but with constancy, you will notice results that will amaze you.<br>\u2028<br>DAILY SCORE WHAT YOU\u2019VE SAVED<br>Add to the main section the object or action that allowed you to save, indicating the date, price, and category. You can view the daily savings in real-time. Don&#39;t forget to mark even the small things, the little matters!<br>\u2028<br>MONITOR SAVINGS WITH STATISTICS<br>With the statistics section, thanks to a colorful and intuitive graph you can constantly keep track of monthly, annual or total savings.<br>Through the list, you can read all the objects you inserted and that makes up the graph displayed at that moment. You can also delete an object if you realize you made a mistake.<br>\u2028<br>SET A GOAL<br>With the goal section, you can set a goal to motivate yourself even more. Once completed, you can always view it on that page, to remind you that if you did it that time, you do it again!<br>In addition, let yourself be inspired by the advice MoneyLisa writes to you in the box with the light bulb :)<br><br><br>Credits: Monna Lisa image by WikiImages from Pixabay",

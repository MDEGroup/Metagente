    "descriptionHtml": "My initial goal was just to make sure that students can get materials to Game Theory and effectively learn from it. Then it came to my mind to make another section for taking notes and making every note accessible while also being able to take control of all of those notes. The ability to add notes directly from the gallery and also being able to take note-pictures right away is most probably what I wanted to make in the first place. After that why not make entire section just for learning materials separately? So I made it. Categorizing each section according to its purpose is very important in my opinion. One thing that was lacking in terms of learning flow at that point was that basically there was no unified groups where inside that they could choose whatever course materials they wanted in that group. So I made fully functional registration system for both students and teachers and added ability to manipulate every course material of their own for instructors. That way students that are enrolled to certain groups can access and directly see what is being added and not needed anymore from them. To join groups though they will need access key which they can get from instructor. In the course section student will be able to access every video material as wells as links to books and quiz of that particular subtopic. Finally it was of huge importance to make quiz section which basically is backbone of every learning system. To make it exceptional though I collected over 1000 of multiple-choice and true-false questions with answers and carefully written explanations as well. This will allow students to harden learned material by revising them and analyzing mistakes they make.  <br><br>Enjoy the app!",

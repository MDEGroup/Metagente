Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

(See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

(See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

Marriage Rummy comes in naturally for those who know how to play the Indian Rummy.<br>Here is a short comparison between the two games<br><br>Number of Decks<br>While the Indian Rummy is played with 1 or 2 decks depending on the number of people, the Marriage Rummy is played with 3 cards.<br><br>Number of Cards Dealt<br>In Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, while in the Marriage Rummy, there are 21 cards.<br><br>Joker Rules<br>In Indian Rummy, a wildcard joker is chosen right at the beginning. However, in Marriage Rummy, only those who have created three pure sequences can choose/see a wildcard joker.<br>Also, while there is a limited number of jokers in Indian Rummy, there are quite a few in Marriage Rummy. (See Marriage Rules above)<br><br>Pure Sequence Rules<br>While only a single pure sequence is required in Indian Rummy, you will need at least three pure sequences in Marriage Rummy to progress in the game.<br><br>Scoring<br>While each card has a specific value in Indian Rummy, the scoring is very different in Marriage Rummy. Those who have seen the joker pay a 3 point but do not finish the game pay a 3 point penalty, while those who have not created three sets of pure sequences pay 10 points.<br>Another difference is that Jokers have a point value in Marriage Rummy. Anyone who holds jokers will claim points from other players. (See Rules above)",

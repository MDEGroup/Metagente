    "descriptionHtml": "Powered the largest and most diverse medical research program. Ever.<br><br>We want to speed up health research and breakthroughs by building a community of a million or more people across the U.S. Join All of Us.<br><br>The goal is to advance personalized medicine, which is health care based on you as an individual. It takes into account factors like where you live, what you do, and your family health history. Personalized medicine aims to tell people the best ways to stay healthy. If someone does get sick, personalized medicine may help health care teams find the treatment that will work best for them.<br><br>We want to find better treatments, targeted to individuals, to help accelerate the path to cures. To get there, we need one million or more people to create the largest and most diverse research database. Those who join will share information about their health over time. Researchers will study this data. We hope to learn about diabetes, heart disease, cancer, asthma and thousands of diseases and genetic conditions that affect many of us. What we learn could improve health for generations to come. <br><br>Participants are our partners. If you join, we\u2019ll share information back with you over time. You could also learn more about your own health.<br><br>HOW THIS WORKS<br><br>1. Download our mobile app and create your account.<br><br>2. If you decide to join, we will ask you to share different kinds of information. We will ask you basic information like your name and where you live, questions about your health, family, home, and work. If you have an electronic health record, we may ask for access. We might also ask you to give samples, like saliva, blood or urine.<br><br>3. The health data we gather from participants will be stored in a database. Approved researchers can access this data to explore how factors like environment, lifestyle, and genes, can impact health. This may help develop new medical treatments that are unique to individuals, and enable a future of precision medicine for all of us.<br><br>WHO CAN PARTICIPATE<br><br>Enrollment is open to all eligible adults who live in the United States. People of every race, ethnicity, sex, gender, and sexual orientation are welcome.<br><br>WHO\u2019S INVOLVED<br><br>The program is led by the National Institutes of Health, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the largest biomedical research organization in the world. We\u2019ve also partnered with some of the top medical centers, research institutions and community organizations, including the Mayo Clinic, Vanderbilt University, Walgreens and WebMD. Plus, more than 250,000+ people like you!<br><br>************************************************************<br><br>PRIVACY AND SECURITY<br><br>All of Us is committed to protecting your privacy.

Ever.<br><br>We want to speed up health research and breakthroughs by building a community of a million or more people across the U.S. Join All of Us.<br><br>The goal is to advance personalized medicine, which is health care based on you as an individual. It takes into account factors like where you live, what you do, and your family health history. Personalized medicine aims to tell people the best ways to stay healthy. If someone does get sick, personalized medicine may help health care teams find the treatment that will work best for them.<br><br>We want to find better treatments, targeted to individuals, to help accelerate the path to cures. To get there, we need one million or more people to create the largest and most diverse research database. Those who join will share information about their health over time. Researchers will study this data. We hope to learn about diabetes, heart disease, cancer, asthma and thousands of diseases and genetic conditions that affect many of us. What we learn could improve health for generations to come. <br><br>Participants are our partners. If you join, we\u2019ll share information back with you over time. You could also learn more about your own health.<br><br>HOW THIS WORKS<br><br>1. Download our mobile app and create your account.<br><br>2. If you decide to join, we will ask you to share different kinds of information. We will ask you basic information like your name and where you live, questions about your health, family, home, and work. If you have an electronic health record, we may ask for access. We might also ask you to give samples, like saliva, blood or urine.<br><br>3. The health data we gather from participants will be stored in a database. Approved researchers can access this data to explore how factors like environment, lifestyle, and genes, can impact health. This may help develop new medical treatments that are unique to individuals, and enable a future of precision medicine for all of us.<br><br>WHO CAN PARTICIPATE<br><br>Enrollment is open to all eligible adults who live in the United States.

Ever.<br><br>We want to speed up health research and breakthroughs by building a community of a million or more people across the U.S. Join All of Us.<br><br>The goal is to advance personalized medicine, which is health care based on you as an individual. It takes into account factors like where you live, what you do, and your family health history. Personalized medicine aims to tell people the best ways to stay healthy. If someone does get sick, personalized medicine may help health care teams find the treatment that will work best for them.<br><br>We want to find better treatments, targeted to individuals, to help accelerate the path to cures. To get there, we need one million or more people to create the largest and most diverse research database. Those who join will share information about their health over time. Researchers will study this data. We hope to learn about diabetes, heart disease, cancer, asthma and thousands of diseases and genetic conditions that affect many of us. What we learn could improve health for generations to come. <br><br>Participants are our partners. If you join, we\u2019ll share information back with you over time. You could also learn more about your own health.<br><br>HOW THIS WORKS<br><br>1. Download our mobile app and create your account.<br><br>2. If you decide to join, we will ask you to share different kinds of information. We will ask you basic information like your name and where you live, questions about your health, family, home, and work. If you have an electronic health record, we may ask for access. We might also ask you to give samples, like saliva, blood or urine.<br><br>3. The health data we gather from participants will be stored in a database. Approved researchers can access this data to explore how factors like environment, lifestyle, and genes, can impact health. This may help develop new medical treatments that are unique to individuals, and enable a future of precision medicine for all of us.<br><br>WHO CAN PARTICIPATE<br><br>Enrollment is open to all eligible adults who live in the United States. People of every race, ethnicity, sex, gender, and sexual orientation are welcome.<br><br>WHO\u2019S INVOLVED<br><br>The program is led by the National Institutes of Health, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the largest biomedical research organization in the world.

Ever.<br><br>We want to speed up health research and breakthroughs by building a community of a million or more people across the U.S. Join All of Us.<br><br>The goal is to advance personalized medicine, which is health care based on you as an individual. It takes into account factors like where you live, what you do, and your family health history. Personalized medicine aims to tell people the best ways to stay healthy. If someone does get sick, personalized medicine may help health care teams find the treatment that will work best for them.<br><br>We want to find better treatments, targeted to individuals, to help accelerate the path to cures. To get there, we need one million or more people to create the largest and most diverse research database. Those who join will share information about their health over time. Researchers will study this data. We hope to learn about diabetes, heart disease, cancer, asthma and thousands of diseases and genetic conditions that affect many of us. What we learn could improve health for generations to come. <br><br>Participants are our partners. If you join, we\u2019ll share information back with you over time. You could also learn more about your own health.<br><br>HOW THIS WORKS<br><br>1. Download our mobile app and create your account.<br><br>2. If you decide to join, we will ask you to share different kinds of information. We will ask you basic information like your name and where you live, questions about your health, family, home, and work. If you have an electronic health record, we may ask for access. We might also ask you to give samples, like saliva, blood or urine.<br><br>3. The health data we gather from participants will be stored in a database.

Ever.<br><br>We want to speed up health research and breakthroughs by building a community of a million or more people across the U.S. Join All of Us.<br><br>The goal is to advance personalized medicine, which is health care based on you as an individual. It takes into account factors like where you live, what you do, and your family health history. Personalized medicine aims to tell people the best ways to stay healthy. If someone does get sick, personalized medicine may help health care teams find the treatment that will work best for them.<br><br>We want to find better treatments, targeted to individuals, to help accelerate the path to cures. To get there, we need one million or more people to create the largest and most diverse research database. Those who join will share information about their health over time. Researchers will study this data. We hope to learn about diabetes, heart disease, cancer, asthma and thousands of diseases and genetic conditions that affect many of us. What we learn could improve health for generations to come. <br><br>Participants are our partners. If you join, we\u2019ll share information back with you over time. You could also learn more about your own health.<br><br>HOW THIS WORKS<br><br>1. Download our mobile app and create your account.<br><br>2. If you decide to join, we will ask you to share different kinds of information. We will ask you basic information like your name and where you live, questions about your health, family, home, and work. If you have an electronic health record, we may ask for access. We might also ask you to give samples, like saliva, blood or urine.<br><br>3. The health data we gather from participants will be stored in a database. Approved researchers can access this data to explore how factors like environment, lifestyle, and genes, can impact health. This may help develop new medical treatments that are unique to individuals, and enable a future of precision medicine for all of us.<br><br>WHO CAN PARTICIPATE<br><br>Enrollment is open to all eligible adults who live in the United States. People of every race, ethnicity, sex, gender, and sexual orientation are welcome.<br><br>WHO\u2019S INVOLVED<br><br>The program is led by the National Institutes of Health, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the largest biomedical research organization in the world. We\u2019ve also partnered with some of the top medical centers, research institutions and community organizations, including the Mayo Clinic, Vanderbilt University, Walgreens and WebMD. Plus, more than 250,000+ people like you!<br><br>************************************************************<br><br>PRIVACY AND SECURITY<br><br>All of Us is committed to protecting your privacy.

Ever.<br><br>We want to speed up health research and breakthroughs by building a community of a million or more people across the U.S. Join All of Us.<br><br>The goal is to advance personalized medicine, which is health care based on you as an individual. It takes into account factors like where you live, what you do, and your family health history. Personalized medicine aims to tell people the best ways to stay healthy. If someone does get sick, personalized medicine may help health care teams find the treatment that will work best for them.<br><br>We want to find better treatments, targeted to individuals, to help accelerate the path to cures. To get there, we need one million or more people to create the largest and most diverse research database. Those who join will share information about their health over time.

    "descriptionHtml": "Powered the largest and most diverse medical research program. Ever.<br><br>We want to speed up health research and breakthroughs by building a community of a million or more people across the U.S. Join All of Us.<br><br>The goal is to advance personalized medicine, which is health care based on you as an individual. It takes into account factors like where you live, what you do, and your family health history. Personalized medicine aims to tell people the best ways to stay healthy. If someone does get sick, personalized medicine may help health care teams find the treatment that will work best for them.<br><br>We want to find better treatments, targeted to individuals, to help accelerate the path to cures. To get there, we need one million or more people to create the largest and most diverse research database. Those who join will share information about their health over time. Researchers will study this data. We hope to learn about diabetes, heart disease, cancer, asthma and thousands of diseases and genetic conditions that affect many of us. What we learn could improve health for generations to come. <br><br>Participants are our partners. If you join, we\u2019ll share information back with you over time. You could also learn more about your own health.<br><br>HOW THIS WORKS<br><br>1. Download our mobile app and create your account.<br><br>2. If you decide to join, we will ask you to share different kinds of information. We will ask you basic information like your name and where you live, questions about your health, family, home, and work. If you have an electronic health record, we may ask for access. We might also ask you to give samples, like saliva, blood or urine.<br><br>3. The health data we gather from participants will be stored in a database. Approved researchers can access this data to explore how factors like environment, lifestyle, and genes, can impact health. This may help develop new medical treatments that are unique to individuals, and enable a future of precision medicine for all of us.<br><br>WHO CAN PARTICIPATE<br><br>Enrollment is open to all eligible adults who live in the United States. People of every race, ethnicity, sex, gender, and sexual orientation are welcome.<br><br>WHO\u2019S INVOLVED<br><br>The program is led by the National Institutes of Health, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the largest biomedical research organization in the world. We\u2019ve also partnered with some of the top medical centers, research institutions and community organizations, including the Mayo Clinic, Vanderbilt University, Walgreens and WebMD. Plus, more than 250,000+ people like you!<br><br>************************************************************<br><br>PRIVACY AND SECURITY<br><br>All of Us is committed to protecting your privacy.

Ever.<br><br>We want to speed up health research and breakthroughs by building a community of a million or more people across the U.S. Join All of Us.<br><br>The goal is to advance personalized medicine, which is health care based on you as an individual. It takes into account factors like where you live, what you do, and your family health history. Personalized medicine aims to tell people the best ways to stay healthy. If someone does get sick, personalized medicine may help health care teams find the treatment that will work best for them.<br><br>We want to find better treatments, targeted to individuals, to help accelerate the path to cures. To get there, we need one million or more people to create the largest and most diverse research database. Those who join will share information about their health over time. Researchers will study this data. We hope to learn about diabetes, heart disease, cancer, asthma and thousands of diseases and genetic conditions that affect many of us. What we learn could improve health for generations to come. <br><br>Participants are our partners. If you join, we\u2019ll share information back with you over time. You could also learn more about your own health.<br><br>HOW THIS WORKS<br><br>1. Download our mobile app and create your account.<br><br>2. If you decide to join, we will ask you to share different kinds of information. We will ask you basic information like your name and where you live, questions about your health, family, home, and work. If you have an electronic health record, we may ask for access. We might also ask you to give samples, like saliva, blood or urine.<br><br>3. The health data we gather from participants will be stored in a database.

Ever.<br><br>We want to speed up health research and breakthroughs by building a community of a million or more people across the U.S. Join All of Us.<br><br>The goal is to advance personalized medicine, which is health care based on you as an individual. It takes into account factors like where you live, what you do, and your family health history. Personalized medicine aims to tell people the best ways to stay healthy. If someone does get sick, personalized medicine may help health care teams find the treatment that will work best for them.<br><br>We want to find better treatments, targeted to individuals, to help accelerate the path to cures. To get there, we need one million or more people to create the largest and most diverse research database. Those who join will share information about their health over time. Researchers will study this data. We hope to learn about diabetes, heart disease, cancer, asthma and thousands of diseases and genetic conditions that affect many of us. What we learn could improve health for generations to come. <br><br>Participants are our partners. If you join, we\u2019ll share information back with you over time. You could also learn more about your own health.<br><br>HOW THIS WORKS<br><br>1. Download our mobile app and create your account.<br><br>2. If you decide to join, we will ask you to share different kinds of information. We will ask you basic information like your name and where you live, questions about your health, family, home, and work. If you have an electronic health record, we may ask for access. We might also ask you to give samples, like saliva, blood or urine.<br><br>3. The health data we gather from participants will be stored in a database. Approved researchers can access this data to explore how factors like environment, lifestyle, and genes, can impact health. This may help develop new medical treatments that are unique to individuals, and enable a future of precision medicine for all of us.<br><br>WHO CAN PARTICIPATE<br><br>Enrollment is open to all eligible adults who live in the United States.

    "descriptionHtml": "Powered the largest and most diverse medical research program. Ever.<br><br>We want to speed up health research and breakthroughs by building a community of a million or more people across the U.S. Join All of Us.<br><br>The goal is to advance personalized medicine, which is health care based on you as an individual. It takes into account factors like where you live, what you do, and your family health history. Personalized medicine aims to tell people the best ways to stay healthy. If someone does get sick, personalized medicine may help health care teams find the treatment that will work best for them.<br><br>We want to find better treatments, targeted to individuals, to help accelerate the path to cures. To get there, we need one million or more people to create the largest and most diverse research database. Those who join will share information about their health over time. Researchers will study this data. We hope to learn about diabetes, heart disease, cancer, asthma and thousands of diseases and genetic conditions that affect many of us. What we learn could improve health for generations to come. <br><br>Participants are our partners. If you join, we\u2019ll share information back with you over time. You could also learn more about your own health.<br><br>HOW THIS WORKS<br><br>1. Download our mobile app and create your account.<br><br>2. If you decide to join, we will ask you to share different kinds of information. We will ask you basic information like your name and where you live, questions about your health, family, home, and work. If you have an electronic health record, we may ask for access. We might also ask you to give samples, like saliva, blood or urine.<br><br>3. The health data we gather from participants will be stored in a database. Approved researchers can access this data to explore how factors like environment, lifestyle, and genes, can impact health. This may help develop new medical treatments that are unique to individuals, and enable a future of precision medicine for all of us.<br><br>WHO CAN PARTICIPATE<br><br>Enrollment is open to all eligible adults who live in the United States. People of every race, ethnicity, sex, gender, and sexual orientation are welcome.<br><br>WHO\u2019S INVOLVED<br><br>The program is led by the National Institutes of Health, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the largest biomedical research organization in the world. We\u2019ve also partnered with some of the top medical centers, research institutions and community organizations, including the Mayo Clinic, Vanderbilt University, Walgreens and WebMD. Plus, more than 250,000+ people like you!<br><br>************************************************************<br><br>PRIVACY AND SECURITY<br><br>All of Us is committed to protecting your privacy.

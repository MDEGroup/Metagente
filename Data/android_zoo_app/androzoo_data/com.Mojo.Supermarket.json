    "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever thought:\u201d Why my child doesn\u2019t want to study or learn something new?\u201d. The answer is quite evident because you make it a necessity. Ask yourself, do you like doing something when you have no choice? No, It\u2019s torture for you. So how to attract a child\u2019s attention? What is the best way to make your children learn something new? You need to make them want to study and learn new things, and after a short brainstorm, you will understand that the answer is a game. Why? Because the game is fun, interactive and they want to play it. They don\u2019t even know that they are learning. That\u2019s the trick! They just enjoy the game and don\u2019t see educational moments of it. The best type of these games is a puzzle. Remembering and using in-game rules implies developing different fundamental skills, and that\u2019s exactly what you need. Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket is precisely this type of game.<br><br>This free app is designed for preschool children 3-8 years old. Tasks will be understandable even for kindergarten age 3-5 and interesting for 6-8 years old. Every level is built so the child will study something new: color, shape, name of the fruits and vegetables, numbers. Mini-games are very different from each other: educational puzzles, basic math, matching, focused on using a fine motor, even logic involved. We remember that it\u2019s all for children, so we made everything full of color, fun, cute and creative. So our little ones won\u2019t feel like they are doing boring exercises because this is exactly what we are trying to avoid. At the end of each level, there will be a reward for your kid with different stickers with animals, insects, vehicles, etc. These can be assembled in various collections.<br><br>While the child is playing the game, baby panda Rocky will help him and give an excellent example of behavior. Rocky is very polite, patient, and kind. That\u2019s what all parents want to see in their little preschoolers. Also, he communicates with kids in simple words so a boy or a girl could understand him easily. Rocky will show your child how to help you in the supermarket, how to differentiate fruits from vegetables, and pay for products. So simple but so entertaining! <br><br>With Rocky, your kid will learn:<br>\u00b7        Numbers<br>\u00b7        Basic math<br>\u00b7        Practice memory<br>\u00b7        Differentiate fruits from vegetables<br>\u00b7        Shapes<br>\u00b7        Colors<br>\u00b7        Train memory, logic, and attention<br>\u00b7        How to purchase and pay for products<br> <br>Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket app for phones and tablets will make studying fun for your children.

    "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever thought:\u201d Why my child doesn\u2019t want to study or learn something new?\u201d. The answer is quite evident because you make it a necessity. Ask yourself, do you like doing something when you have no choice? No, It\u2019s torture for you.<br><br>So how to attract a child\u2019s attention?<br><br>What is the best way to make your children learn something new?<br><br>You need to make them want to study and learn new things, and after a short brainstorm, you will understand that the answer is a kids\u2019 game. Why? Because the game for kids is fun and they want to play it. They don\u2019t even know that they are learning. That\u2019s the trick! They just enjoy the game and don\u2019t see educational moments of it. The best type of these games is a puzzle and a matching. Remembering and using in-game rules implies developing different fundamental skills, and that\u2019s what you need. Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket is exactly this type of learning game for kids.<br><br>This free app is designed for preschool children 3-8 years old. Tasks will be understandable even for kindergarten age 3-5 and interesting for 6-8 years old. Every level is built so the child will study something new: math and logic, color and shape, name of the fruits and vegetables, and numbers. Mini-kids learning games are very different from each other: educational puzzles, basic math, matching, focused on using the fine motor, even logic involved. We remember that it\u2019s all for children, so we made everything full of color, fun, cute and creative. So our little ones won\u2019t feel like they are doing boring educational exercises because this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. <br><br>This is a creative game! That is why at each level, there will be a reward for your kid with different stickers with animals, insects, vehicles, etc. These can be assembled in various collections.<br><br>With Rocky, your kid will learn:<br>\u00b7        Numbers and basic math<br>\u00b7        Practice memory<br>\u00b7        Differentiate fruits from vegetables<br>\u00b7        Shapes and colors<br>\u00b7        Train  logic and attention<br>\u00b7        How to purchase and pay for products<br><br>While the child is playing this learning app, Baby Panda Rocky will help him and give an excellent example of behavior. Rocky is very polite, patient, and kind. That\u2019s what all parents want to see in their little preschoolers. Also, he communicates with kids in simple words so a boy or a girl could understand him easily. Our educational game with Rocky will show your child how to help you in the supermarket, so simple but so entertaining! <br><br>Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket app for phones and tablets will make studying fun for your children. They will solve puzzles, count, learn new words, and understand how shopping is working. Also, Rocky is an excellent example of children. They can even pick a few traits from him and start helping a family with groceries. And all this while playing a simple app, who would have thought. You will be happy with the result, and it will be noticeable. Children are entertained by gaining knowledge, and parents are delighted that their kids are learning something new. Install our app and see it for yourself.<br><br>About Mojo Mobiles Games:<br>It is our passion to make unique and educational games for kids. We combine creative and educational approaches to deliver the best for children and their parents.<br>We are happy to help parents to entertain and educate their kids by using modern approaches where gamification and teaching go together.

    "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever thought:\u201d Why my child doesn\u2019t want to study or learn something new?\u201d. The answer is quite evident because you make it a necessity. Ask yourself, do you like doing something when you have no choice? No, It\u2019s torture for you.<br><br>So how to attract a child\u2019s attention?<br><br>What is the best way to make your children learn something new?<br><br>You need to make them want to study and learn new things, and after a short brainstorm, you will understand that the answer is a kids\u2019 game. Why? Because the game for kids is fun and they want to play it. They don\u2019t even know that they are learning. That\u2019s the trick! They just enjoy the game and don\u2019t see educational moments of it. The best type of these games is a puzzle and a matching. Remembering and using in-game rules implies developing different fundamental skills, and that\u2019s what you need. Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket is exactly this type of learning game for kids.<br><br>This free app is designed for preschool children 3-8 years old. Tasks will be understandable even for kindergarten age 3-5 and interesting for 6-8 years old. Every level is built so the child will study something new: math and logic, color and shape, name of the fruits and vegetables, and numbers. Mini-kids learning games are very different from each other: educational puzzles, basic math, matching, focused on using the fine motor, even logic involved. We remember that it\u2019s all for children, so we made everything full of color, fun, cute and creative. So our little ones won\u2019t feel like they are doing boring educational exercises because this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. <br><br>This is a creative game! That is why at each level, there will be a reward for your kid with different stickers with animals, insects, vehicles, etc. These can be assembled in various collections.<br><br>With Rocky, your kid will learn:<br>\u00b7        Numbers and basic math<br>\u00b7        Practice memory<br>\u00b7        Differentiate fruits from vegetables<br>\u00b7        Shapes and colors<br>\u00b7        Train  logic and attention<br>\u00b7        How to purchase and pay for products<br><br>While the child is playing this learning app, Baby Panda Rocky will help him and give an excellent example of behavior. Rocky is very polite, patient, and kind. That\u2019s what all parents want to see in their little preschoolers. Also, he communicates with kids in simple words so a boy or a girl could understand him easily. Our educational game with Rocky will show your child how to help you in the supermarket, so simple but so entertaining! <br><br>Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket app for phones and tablets will make studying fun for your children. They will solve puzzles, count, learn new words, and understand how shopping is working. Also, Rocky is an excellent example of children. They can even pick a few traits from him and start helping a family with groceries. And all this while playing a simple app, who would have thought. You will be happy with the result, and it will be noticeable. Children are entertained by gaining knowledge, and parents are delighted that their kids are learning something new. Install our app and see it for yourself.<br><br>About Mojo Mobiles Games:<br>It is our passion to make unique and educational games for kids.

    "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever thought:\u201d Why my child doesn\u2019t want to study or learn something new?\u201d. The answer is quite evident because you make it a necessity. Ask yourself, do you like doing something when you have no choice? No, It\u2019s torture for you.<br><br>So how to attract a child\u2019s attention?<br><br>What is the best way to make your children learn something new?<br><br>You need to make them want to study and learn new things, and after a short brainstorm, you will understand that the answer is a kids\u2019 game. Why? Because the game for kids is fun and they want to play it. They don\u2019t even know that they are learning. That\u2019s the trick! They just enjoy the game and don\u2019t see educational moments of it. The best type of these games is a puzzle and a matching. Remembering and using in-game rules implies developing different fundamental skills, and that\u2019s what you need. Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket is exactly this type of learning game for kids.<br><br>This free app is designed for preschool children 3-8 years old. Tasks will be understandable even for kindergarten age 3-5 and interesting for 6-8 years old. Every level is built so the child will study something new: math and logic, color and shape, name of the fruits and vegetables, and numbers. Mini-kids learning games are very different from each other: educational puzzles, basic math, matching, focused on using the fine motor, even logic involved. We remember that it\u2019s all for children, so we made everything full of color, fun, cute and creative. So our little ones won\u2019t feel like they are doing boring educational exercises because this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. <br><br>This is a creative game! That is why at each level, there will be a reward for your kid with different stickers with animals, insects, vehicles, etc. These can be assembled in various collections.<br><br>With Rocky, your kid will learn:<br>\u00b7        Numbers and basic math<br>\u00b7        Practice memory<br>\u00b7        Differentiate fruits from vegetables<br>\u00b7        Shapes and colors<br>\u00b7        Train  logic and attention<br>\u00b7        How to purchase and pay for products<br><br>While the child is playing this learning app, Baby Panda Rocky will help him and give an excellent example of behavior.

    "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever thought:\u201d Why my child doesn\u2019t want to study or learn something new?\u201d. The answer is quite evident because you make it a necessity. Ask yourself, do you like doing something when you have no choice? No, It\u2019s torture for you.<br><br>So how to attract a child\u2019s attention?<br><br>What is the best way to make your children learn something new?<br><br>You need to make them want to study and learn new things, and after a short brainstorm, you will understand that the answer is a kids\u2019 game. Why? Because the game for kids is fun and they want to play it. They don\u2019t even know that they are learning. That\u2019s the trick! They just enjoy the game and don\u2019t see educational moments of it. The best type of these games is a puzzle and a matching. Remembering and using in-game rules implies developing different fundamental skills, and that\u2019s what you need. Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket is exactly this type of learning game for kids.<br><br>This free app is designed for preschool children 3-8 years old. Tasks will be understandable even for kindergarten age 3-5 and interesting for 6-8 years old. Every level is built so the child will study something new: math and logic, color and shape, name of the fruits and vegetables, and numbers. Mini-kids learning games are very different from each other: educational puzzles, basic math, matching, focused on using the fine motor, even logic involved. We remember that it\u2019s all for children, so we made everything full of color, fun, cute and creative. So our little ones won\u2019t feel like they are doing boring educational exercises because this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. <br><br>This is a creative game! That is why at each level, there will be a reward for your kid with different stickers with animals, insects, vehicles, etc. These can be assembled in various collections.<br><br>With Rocky, your kid will learn:<br>\u00b7        Numbers and basic math<br>\u00b7        Practice memory<br>\u00b7        Differentiate fruits from vegetables<br>\u00b7        Shapes and colors<br>\u00b7        Train  logic and attention<br>\u00b7        How to purchase and pay for products<br><br>While the child is playing this learning app, Baby Panda Rocky will help him and give an excellent example of behavior. Rocky is very polite, patient, and kind. That\u2019s what all parents want to see in their little preschoolers. Also, he communicates with kids in simple words so a boy or a girl could understand him easily. Our educational game with Rocky will show your child how to help you in the supermarket, so simple but so entertaining! <br><br>Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket app for phones and tablets will make studying fun for your children. They will solve puzzles, count, learn new words, and understand how shopping is working. Also, Rocky is an excellent example of children. They can even pick a few traits from him and start helping a family with groceries. And all this while playing a simple app, who would have thought. You will be happy with the result, and it will be noticeable. Children are entertained by gaining knowledge, and parents are delighted that their kids are learning something new. Install our app and see it for yourself.<br><br>About Mojo Mobiles Games:<br>It is our passion to make unique and educational games for kids. We combine creative and educational approaches to deliver the best for children and their parents.<br>We are happy to help parents to entertain and educate their kids by using modern approaches where gamification and teaching go together.

    "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever thought:\u201d Why my child doesn\u2019t want to study or learn something new?\u201d. The answer is quite evident because you make it a necessity. Ask yourself, do you like doing something when you have no choice? No, It\u2019s torture for you.<br><br>So how to attract a child\u2019s attention?<br><br>What is the best way to make your children learn something new?<br><br>You need to make them want to study and learn new things, and after a short brainstorm, you will understand that the answer is a kids\u2019 game. Why? Because the game for kids is fun and they want to play it. They don\u2019t even know that they are learning. That\u2019s the trick! They just enjoy the game and don\u2019t see educational moments of it. The best type of these games is a puzzle and a matching. Remembering and using in-game rules implies developing different fundamental skills, and that\u2019s what you need. Baby Red Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket is exactly this type of learning game for kids.<br><br>This free app is designed for preschool children 3-8 years old. Tasks will be understandable even for kindergarten age 3-5 and interesting for 6-8 years old. Every level is built so the child will study something new: math and logic, color and shape, name of the fruits and vegetables, and numbers. Mini-kids learning games are very different from each other: educational puzzles, basic math, matching, focused on using the fine motor, even logic involved. We remember that it\u2019s all for children, so we made everything full of color, fun, cute and creative. So our little ones won\u2019t feel like they are doing boring educational exercises because this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. <br><br>This is a creative game! That is why at each level, there will be a reward for your kid with different stickers with animals, insects, vehicles, etc. These can be assembled in various collections.<br><br>With Rocky, your kid will learn:<br>\u00b7        Numbers and basic math<br>\u00b7        Practice memory<br>\u00b7        Differentiate fruits from vegetables<br>\u00b7        Shapes and colors<br>\u00b7        Train  logic and attention<br>\u00b7        How to purchase and pay for products<br><br>While the child is playing this learning app, Baby Red Panda Rocky will help him and give an excellent example of behavior. Rocky is very polite, patient, and kind. That\u2019s what all parents want to see in their little preschoolers. Also, he communicates with kids in simple words so a boy or a girl could understand him easily. Our educational game with Rocky will show your child how to help you in the supermarket, so simple but so entertaining! <br><br>Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket app for phones and tablets will make studying fun for your children. They will solve puzzles, count, learn new words, and understand how shopping is working. Also, Rocky is an excellent example of children. They can even pick a few traits from him and start helping a family with groceries. And all this while playing a simple app, who would have thought. You will be happy with the result, and it will be noticeable. Children are entertained by gaining knowledge, and parents are delighted that their kids are learning something new. Install our app and see it for yourself.<br><br>About Mojo Mobiles Games:<br>It is our passion to make unique and educational games for kids. We combine creative and educational approaches to deliver the best for children and their parents.<br>We are happy to help parents to entertain and educate their kids by using modern approaches where gamification and teaching go together. We even go further and make beta tests in kindergartens with the exact target audience to deliver the best fitting games.<br><br>\ud83d\udce7 We are open to any suggestions and comments as we permanently improve our games.<br>Contact us at any time: studio@mojomobiles.games",

Ask yourself, do you like doing something when you have no choice? No, It\u2019s torture for you.<br><br>So how to attract a child\u2019s attention?<br><br>What is the best way to make your children learn something new?<br><br>You need to make them want to study and learn new things, and after a short brainstorm, you will understand that the answer is a kids\u2019 game. Why? Because the game for kids is fun and they want to play it. They don\u2019t even know that they are learning. That\u2019s the trick! They just enjoy the game and don\u2019t see educational moments of it. The best type of these games is a puzzle and a matching. Remembering and using in-game rules implies developing different fundamental skills, and that\u2019s what you need. Baby Red Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket is exactly this type of learning game for kids.<br><br>This free app is designed for preschool children 3-8 years old. Tasks will be understandable even for kindergarten age 3-5 and interesting for 6-8 years old. Every level is built so the child will study something new: math and logic, color and shape, name of the fruits and vegetables, and numbers. Mini-kids learning games are very different from each other: educational puzzles, basic math, matching, focused on using the fine motor, even logic involved. We remember that it\u2019s all for children, so we made everything full of color, fun, cute and creative. So our little ones won\u2019t feel like they are doing boring educational exercises because this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. <br><br>This is a creative game!

    "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever thought:\u201d Why my child doesn\u2019t want to study or learn something new?\u201d. The answer is quite evident because you make it a necessity. Ask yourself, do you like doing something when you have no choice? No, It\u2019s torture for you.<br><br>So how to attract a child\u2019s attention?<br><br>What is the best way to make your children learn something new?<br><br>You need to make them want to study and learn new things, and after a short brainstorm, you will understand that the answer is a kids\u2019 game. Why? Because the game for kids is fun and they want to play it. They don\u2019t even know that they are learning. That\u2019s the trick! They just enjoy the game and don\u2019t see educational moments of it. The best type of these games is a puzzle and a matching. Remembering and using in-game rules implies developing different fundamental skills, and that\u2019s what you need. Baby Red Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket is exactly this type of learning game for kids.<br><br>This free app is designed for preschool children 3-8 years old. Tasks will be understandable even for kindergarten age 3-5 and interesting for 6-8 years old. Every level is built so the child will study something new: math and logic, color and shape, name of the fruits and vegetables, and numbers. Mini-kids learning games are very different from each other: educational puzzles, basic math, matching, focused on using the fine motor, even logic involved. We remember that it\u2019s all for children, so we made everything full of color, fun, cute and creative. So our little ones won\u2019t feel like they are doing boring educational exercises because this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. <br><br>This is a creative game! That is why at each level, there will be a reward for your kid with different stickers with animals, insects, vehicles, etc. These can be assembled in various collections.<br><br>With Rocky, your kid will learn:<br>\u00b7        Numbers and basic math<br>\u00b7        Practice memory<br>\u00b7        Differentiate fruits from vegetables<br>\u00b7        Shapes and colors<br>\u00b7        Train  logic and attention<br>\u00b7        How to purchase and pay for products<br><br>While the child is playing this learning app, Baby Red Panda Rocky will help him and give an excellent example of behavior. Rocky is very polite, patient, and kind. That\u2019s what all parents want to see in their little preschoolers. Also, he communicates with kids in simple words so a boy or a girl could understand him easily. Our educational game with Rocky will show your child how to help you in the supermarket, so simple but so entertaining! <br><br>Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket app for phones and tablets will make studying fun for your children. They will solve puzzles, count, learn new words, and understand how shopping is working. Also, Rocky is an excellent example of children. They can even pick a few traits from him and start helping a family with groceries. And all this while playing a simple app, who would have thought. You will be happy with the result, and it will be noticeable. Children are entertained by gaining knowledge, and parents are delighted that their kids are learning something new. Install our app and see it for yourself.<br><br>About Mojo Mobiles Games:<br>It is our passion to make unique and educational games for kids. We combine creative and educational approaches to deliver the best for children and their parents.<br>We are happy to help parents to entertain and educate their kids by using modern approaches where gamification and teaching go together.

    "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever thought:\u201d Why my child doesn\u2019t want to study or learn something new?\u201d. The answer is quite evident because you make it a necessity. Ask yourself, do you like doing something when you have no choice? No, It\u2019s torture for you.<br><br>So how to attract a child\u2019s attention?<br><br>What is the best way to make your children learn something new?<br><br>You need to make them want to study and learn new things, and after a short brainstorm, you will understand that the answer is a kids\u2019 game. Why? Because the game for kids is fun and they want to play it. They don\u2019t even know that they are learning. That\u2019s the trick! They just enjoy the game and don\u2019t see educational moments of it. The best type of these games is a puzzle and a matching. Remembering and using in-game rules implies developing different fundamental skills, and that\u2019s what you need. Baby Red Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket is exactly this type of learning game for kids.<br><br>This free app is designed for preschool children 3-8 years old. Tasks will be understandable even for kindergarten age 3-5 and interesting for 6-8 years old. Every level is built so the child will study something new: math and logic, color and shape, name of the fruits and vegetables, and numbers. Mini-kids learning games are very different from each other: educational puzzles, basic math, matching, focused on using the fine motor, even logic involved. We remember that it\u2019s all for children, so we made everything full of color, fun, cute and creative. So our little ones won\u2019t feel like they are doing boring educational exercises because this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. <br><br>This is a creative game! That is why at each level, there will be a reward for your kid with different stickers with animals, insects, vehicles, etc. These can be assembled in various collections.<br><br>With Rocky, your kid will learn:<br>\u00b7        Numbers and basic math<br>\u00b7        Practice memory<br>\u00b7        Differentiate fruits from vegetables<br>\u00b7        Shapes and colors<br>\u00b7        Train  logic and attention<br>\u00b7        How to purchase and pay for products<br><br>While the child is playing this learning app, Baby Red Panda Rocky will help him and give an excellent example of behavior. Rocky is very polite, patient, and kind. That\u2019s what all parents want to see in their little preschoolers. Also, he communicates with kids in simple words so a boy or a girl could understand him easily. Our educational game with Rocky will show your child how to help you in the supermarket, so simple but so entertaining! <br><br>Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket app for phones and tablets will make studying fun for your children. They will solve puzzles, count, learn new words, and understand how shopping is working. Also, Rocky is an excellent example of children. They can even pick a few traits from him and start helping a family with groceries. And all this while playing a simple app, who would have thought. You will be happy with the result, and it will be noticeable. Children are entertained by gaining knowledge, and parents are delighted that their kids are learning something new.

    "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever thought:\u201d Why my child doesn\u2019t want to study or learn something new?\u201d. The answer is quite evident because you make it a necessity. Ask yourself, do you like doing something when you have no choice? No, It\u2019s torture for you.<br><br>So how to attract a child\u2019s attention?<br><br>What is the best way to make your children learn something new?<br><br>You need to make them want to study and learn new things, and after a short brainstorm, you will understand that the answer is a kids\u2019 game. Why? Because the game for kids is fun and they want to play it. They don\u2019t even know that they are learning. That\u2019s the trick! They just enjoy the game and don\u2019t see educational moments of it. The best type of these games is a puzzle and a matching. Remembering and using in-game rules implies developing different fundamental skills, and that\u2019s what you need. Baby Red Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket is exactly this type of learning game for kids.<br><br>This free app is designed for preschool children 3-8 years old. Tasks will be understandable even for kindergarten age 3-5 and interesting for 6-8 years old. Every level is built so the child will study something new: math and logic, color and shape, name of the fruits and vegetables, and numbers. Mini-kids learning games are very different from each other: educational puzzles, basic math, matching, focused on using the fine motor, even logic involved. We remember that it\u2019s all for children, so we made everything full of color, fun, cute and creative. So our little ones won\u2019t feel like they are doing boring educational exercises because this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. <br><br>This is a creative game! That is why at each level, there will be a reward for your kid with different stickers with animals, insects, vehicles, etc. These can be assembled in various collections.<br><br>With Rocky, your kid will learn:<br>\u00b7        Numbers and basic math<br>\u00b7        Practice memory<br>\u00b7        Differentiate fruits from vegetables<br>\u00b7        Shapes and colors<br>\u00b7        Train  logic and attention<br>\u00b7        How to purchase and pay for products<br><br>While the child is playing this learning app, Baby Red Panda Rocky will help him and give an excellent example of behavior. Rocky is very polite, patient, and kind. That\u2019s what all parents want to see in their little preschoolers. Also, he communicates with kids in simple words so a boy or a girl could understand him easily. Our educational game with Rocky will show your child how to help you in the supermarket, so simple but so entertaining! <br><br>Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket app for phones and tablets will make studying fun for your children. They will solve puzzles, count, learn new words, and understand how shopping is working. Also, Rocky is an excellent example of children. They can even pick a few traits from him and start helping a family with groceries. And all this while playing a simple app, who would have thought. You will be happy with the result, and it will be noticeable. Children are entertained by gaining knowledge, and parents are delighted that their kids are learning something new.

    "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever thought:\u201d Why my child doesn\u2019t want to study or learn something new?\u201d. The answer is quite evident because you make it a necessity. Ask yourself, do you like doing something when you have no choice? No, It\u2019s torture for you.<br><br>So how to attract a child\u2019s attention?<br><br>What is the best way to make your children learn something new?<br><br>You need to make them want to study and learn new things, and after a short brainstorm, you will understand that the answer is a kids\u2019 game. Why? Because the game for kids is fun and they want to play it. They don\u2019t even know that they are learning. That\u2019s the trick! They just enjoy the game and don\u2019t see educational moments of it. The best type of these games is a puzzle and a matching. Remembering and using in-game rules implies developing different fundamental skills, and that\u2019s what you need. Baby Red Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket is exactly this type of learning game for kids.<br><br>This free app is designed for preschool children 3-8 years old. Tasks will be understandable even for kindergarten age 3-5 and interesting for 6-8 years old. Every level is built so the child will study something new: math and logic, color and shape, name of the fruits and vegetables, and numbers. Mini-kids learning games are very different from each other: educational puzzles, basic math, matching, focused on using the fine motor, even logic involved. We remember that it\u2019s all for children, so we made everything full of color, fun, cute and creative. So our little ones won\u2019t feel like they are doing boring educational exercises because this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. <br><br>This is a creative game! That is why at each level, there will be a reward for your kid with different stickers with animals, insects, vehicles, etc. These can be assembled in various collections.<br><br>With Rocky, your kid will learn:<br>\u00b7        Numbers and basic math<br>\u00b7        Practice memory<br>\u00b7        Differentiate fruits from vegetables<br>\u00b7        Shapes and colors<br>\u00b7        Train  logic and attention<br>\u00b7        How to purchase and pay for products<br><br>While the child is playing this learning app, Baby Red Panda Rocky will help him and give an excellent example of behavior. Rocky is very polite, patient, and kind. That\u2019s what all parents want to see in their little preschoolers. Also, he communicates with kids in simple words so a boy or a girl could understand him easily. Our educational game with Rocky will show your child how to help you in the supermarket, so simple but so entertaining! <br><br>Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket app for phones and tablets will make studying fun for your children. They will solve puzzles, count, learn new words, and understand how shopping is working. Also, Rocky is an excellent example of children. They can even pick a few traits from him and start helping a family with groceries. And all this while playing a simple app, who would have thought. You will be happy with the result, and it will be noticeable. Children are entertained by gaining knowledge, and parents are delighted that their kids are learning something new. Install our app and see it for yourself.<br><br>About Mojo Mobiles Games:<br>It is our passion to make unique and educational games for kids. We combine creative and educational approaches to deliver the best for children and their parents.<br>We are happy to help parents to entertain and educate their kids by using modern approaches where gamification and teaching go together. We even go further and make beta tests in kindergartens with the exact target audience to deliver the best fitting games.<br><br>\ud83d\udce7 We are open to any suggestions and comments as we permanently improve our games.<br>Contact us at any time: studio@mojomobiles.games",

No, It\u2019s torture for you.<br><br>So how to attract a child\u2019s attention?<br><br>What is the best way to make your children learn something new?<br><br>You need to make them want to study and learn new things, and after a short brainstorm, you will understand that the answer is a kids\u2019 game. Why? Because the game for kids is fun and they want to play it. They don\u2019t even know that they are learning. That\u2019s the trick! They just enjoy the game and don\u2019t see educational moments of it. The best type of these games is a puzzle and a matching. Remembering and using in-game rules implies developing different fundamental skills, and that\u2019s what you need. Baby Red Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket is exactly this type of learning game for kids.<br><br>This free app is designed for preschool children 3-8 years old. Tasks will be understandable even for kindergarten age 3-5 and interesting for 6-8 years old. Every level is built so the child will study something new: math and logic, color and shape, name of the fruits and vegetables, and numbers. Mini-kids learning games are very different from each other: educational puzzles, basic math, matching, focused on using the fine motor, even logic involved. We remember that it\u2019s all for children, so we made everything full of color, fun, cute and creative. So our little ones won\u2019t feel like they are doing boring educational exercises because this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. <br><br>This is a creative game! That is why at each level, there will be a reward for your kid with different stickers with animals, insects, vehicles, etc. These can be assembled in various collections.<br><br>With Rocky, your kid will learn:<br>\u00b7        Numbers and basic math<br>\u00b7        Practice memory<br>\u00b7        Differentiate fruits from vegetables<br>\u00b7        Shapes and colors<br>\u00b7        Train  logic and attention<br>\u00b7        How to purchase and pay for products<br><br>While the child is playing this learning app, Baby Red Panda Rocky will help him and give an excellent example of behavior.

    "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever thought:\u201d Why my child doesn\u2019t want to study or learn something new?\u201d. The answer is quite evident because you make it a necessity. Ask yourself, do you like doing something when you have no choice? No, It\u2019s torture for you.<br><br>So how to attract a child\u2019s attention?<br><br>What is the best way to make your children learn something new?<br><br>You need to make them want to study and learn new things, and after a short brainstorm, you will understand that the answer is a kids\u2019 game. Why? Because the game for kids is fun and they want to play it. They don\u2019t even know that they are learning. That\u2019s the trick! They just enjoy the game and don\u2019t see educational moments of it. The best type of these games is a puzzle and a matching. Remembering and using in-game rules implies developing different fundamental skills, and that\u2019s what you need. Baby Red Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket is exactly this type of learning game for kids.<br><br>This free app is designed for preschool children 3-8 years old. Tasks will be understandable even for kindergarten age 3-5 and interesting for 6-8 years old. Every level is built so the child will study something new: math and logic, color and shape, name of the fruits and vegetables, and numbers. Mini-kids learning games are very different from each other: educational puzzles, basic math, matching, focused on using the fine motor, even logic involved. We remember that it\u2019s all for children, so we made everything full of color, fun, cute and creative. So our little ones won\u2019t feel like they are doing boring educational exercises because this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. <br><br>This is a creative game! That is why at each level, there will be a reward for your kid with different stickers with animals, insects, vehicles, etc. These can be assembled in various collections.<br><br>With Rocky, your kid will learn:<br>\u00b7        Numbers and basic math<br>\u00b7        Practice memory<br>\u00b7        Differentiate fruits from vegetables<br>\u00b7        Shapes and colors<br>\u00b7        Train  logic and attention<br>\u00b7        How to purchase and pay for products<br><br>While the child is playing this learning app, Baby Red Panda Rocky will help him and give an excellent example of behavior. Rocky is very polite, patient, and kind. That\u2019s what all parents want to see in their little preschoolers. Also, he communicates with kids in simple words so a boy or a girl could understand him easily. Our educational game with Rocky will show your child how to help you in the supermarket, so simple but so entertaining! <br><br>Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket app for phones and tablets will make studying fun for your children. They will solve puzzles, count, learn new words, and understand how shopping is working. Also, Rocky is an excellent example of children. They can even pick a few traits from him and start helping a family with groceries. And all this while playing a simple app, who would have thought. You will be happy with the result, and it will be noticeable. Children are entertained by gaining knowledge, and parents are delighted that their kids are learning something new. Install our app and see it for yourself.<br><br>About Mojo Mobiles Games:<br>It is our passion to make unique and educational games for kids. We combine creative and educational approaches to deliver the best for children and their parents.<br>We are happy to help parents to entertain and educate their kids by using modern approaches where gamification and teaching go together. We even go further and make beta tests in kindergartens with the exact target audience to deliver the best fitting games.<br><br>\ud83d\udce7 We are open to any suggestions and comments as we permanently improve our games.<br>Contact us at any time: studio@mojomobiles.games",

    "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever thought:\u201d Why my child doesn\u2019t want to study or learn something new?\u201d. The answer is quite evident because you make it a necessity. Ask yourself, do you like doing something when you have no choice? No, It\u2019s torture for you.<br><br>So how to attract a child\u2019s attention?<br><br>What is the best way to make your children learn something new?<br><br>You need to make them want to study and learn new things, and after a short brainstorm, you will understand that the answer is a kids\u2019 game. Why? Because the game for kids is fun and they want to play it. They don\u2019t even know that they are learning. That\u2019s the trick! They just enjoy the game and don\u2019t see educational moments of it. The best type of these games is a puzzle and a matching. Remembering and using in-game rules implies developing different fundamental skills, and that\u2019s what you need. Baby Red Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket is exactly this type of learning game for kids.<br><br>This free app is designed for preschool children 3-8 years old. Tasks will be understandable even for kindergarten age 3-5 and interesting for 6-8 years old. Every level is built so the child will study something new: math and logic, color and shape, name of the fruits and vegetables, and numbers. Mini-kids learning games are very different from each other: educational puzzles, basic math, matching, focused on using the fine motor, even logic involved. We remember that it\u2019s all for children, so we made everything full of color, fun, cute and creative. So our little ones won\u2019t feel like they are doing boring educational exercises because this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. <br><br>This is a creative game! That is why at each level, there will be a reward for your kid with different stickers with animals, insects, vehicles, etc. These can be assembled in various collections.<br><br>With Rocky, your kid will learn:<br>\u00b7        Numbers and basic math<br>\u00b7        Practice memory<br>\u00b7        Differentiate fruits from vegetables<br>\u00b7        Shapes and colors<br>\u00b7        Train  logic and attention<br>\u00b7        How to purchase and pay for products<br><br>While the child is playing this learning app, Baby Red Panda Rocky will help him and give an excellent example of behavior. Rocky is very polite, patient, and kind. That\u2019s what all parents want to see in their little preschoolers. Also, he communicates with kids in simple words so a boy or a girl could understand him easily. Our educational game with Rocky will show your child how to help you in the supermarket, so simple but so entertaining! <br><br>Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket app for phones and tablets will make studying fun for your children.

    "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever thought:\u201d Why my child doesn\u2019t want to study or learn something new?\u201d. The answer is quite evident because you make it a necessity. Ask yourself, do you like doing something when you have no choice? No, It\u2019s torture for you.<br><br>So how to attract a child\u2019s attention?<br><br>What is the best way to make your children learn something new?<br><br>You need to make them want to study and learn new things, and after a short brainstorm, you will understand that the answer is a kids\u2019 game. Why? Because the game for kids is fun and they want to play it. They don\u2019t even know that they are learning. That\u2019s the trick! They just enjoy the game and don\u2019t see educational moments of it. The best type of these games is a puzzle and a matching. Remembering and using in-game rules implies developing different fundamental skills, and that\u2019s what you need. Baby Red Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket is exactly this type of learning game for kids.<br><br>This free app is designed for preschool children 3-8 years old. Tasks will be understandable even for kindergarten age 3-5 and interesting for 6-8 years old. Every level is built so the child will study something new: math and logic, color and shape, name of the fruits and vegetables, and numbers. Mini-kids learning games are very different from each other: educational puzzles, basic math, matching, focused on using the fine motor, even logic involved. We remember that it\u2019s all for children, so we made everything full of color, fun, cute and creative. So our little ones won\u2019t feel like they are doing boring educational exercises because this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. <br><br>This is a creative game! That is why at each level, there will be a reward for your kid with different stickers with animals, insects, vehicles, etc. These can be assembled in various collections.<br><br>With Rocky, your kid will learn:<br>\u00b7        Numbers and basic math<br>\u00b7        Practice memory<br>\u00b7        Differentiate fruits from vegetables<br>\u00b7        Shapes and colors<br>\u00b7        Train  logic and attention<br>\u00b7        How to purchase and pay for products<br><br>While the child is playing this learning app, Baby Red Panda Rocky will help him and give an excellent example of behavior. Rocky is very polite, patient, and kind. That\u2019s what all parents want to see in their little preschoolers. Also, he communicates with kids in simple words so a boy or a girl could understand him easily. Our educational game with Rocky will show your child how to help you in the supermarket, so simple but so entertaining! <br><br>Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket app for phones and tablets will make studying fun for your children. They will solve puzzles, count, learn new words, and understand how shopping is working. Also, Rocky is an excellent example of children. They can even pick a few traits from him and start helping a family with groceries. And all this while playing a simple app, who would have thought. You will be happy with the result, and it will be noticeable. Children are entertained by gaining knowledge, and parents are delighted that their kids are learning something new. Install our app and see it for yourself.<br><br>About Mojo Mobiles Games:<br>It is our passion to make unique and educational games for kids. We combine creative and educational approaches to deliver the best for children and their parents.<br>We are happy to help parents to entertain and educate their kids by using modern approaches where gamification and teaching go together. We even go further and make beta tests in kindergartens with the exact target audience to deliver the best fitting games.<br><br>\ud83d\udce7 We are open to any suggestions and comments as we permanently improve our games.<br>Contact us at any time: studio@mojomobiles.games",

    "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever thought:\u201d Why my child doesn\u2019t want to study or learn something new?\u201d. The answer is quite evident because you make it a necessity. Ask yourself, do you like doing something when you have no choice? No, It\u2019s torture for you.<br><br>So how to attract a child\u2019s attention?<br><br>What is the best way to make your children learn something new?<br><br>You need to make them want to study and learn new things, and after a short brainstorm, you will understand that the answer is a kids\u2019 game. Why? Because the game for kids is fun and they want to play it. They don\u2019t even know that they are learning. That\u2019s the trick! They just enjoy the game and don\u2019t see educational moments of it. The best type of these games is a puzzle and a matching. Remembering and using in-game rules implies developing different fundamental skills, and that\u2019s what you need. Baby Red Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket is exactly this type of learning game for kids.<br><br>This free app is designed for preschool children 3-8 years old. Tasks will be understandable even for kindergarten age 3-5 and interesting for 6-8 years old. Every level is built so the child will study something new: math and logic, color and shape, name of the fruits and vegetables, and numbers. Mini-kids learning games are very different from each other: educational puzzles, basic math, matching, focused on using the fine motor, even logic involved. We remember that it\u2019s all for children, so we made everything full of color, fun, cute and creative. So our little ones won\u2019t feel like they are doing boring educational exercises because this is precisely what we are trying to avoid. <br><br>This is a creative game! That is why at each level, there will be a reward for your kid with different stickers with animals, insects, vehicles, etc. These can be assembled in various collections.<br><br>With Rocky, your kid will learn:<br>\u00b7        Numbers and basic math<br>\u00b7        Practice memory<br>\u00b7        Differentiate fruits from vegetables<br>\u00b7        Shapes and colors<br>\u00b7        Train  logic and attention<br>\u00b7        How to purchase and pay for products<br><br>While the child is playing this learning app, Baby Red Panda Rocky will help him and give an excellent example of behavior. Rocky is very polite, patient, and kind. That\u2019s what all parents want to see in their little preschoolers. Also, he communicates with kids in simple words so a boy or a girl could understand him easily. Our educational game with Rocky will show your child how to help you in the supermarket, so simple but so entertaining! <br><br>Baby Panda&#39;s Rocky Supermarket app for phones and tablets will make studying fun for your children. They will solve puzzles, count, learn new words, and understand how shopping is working. Also, Rocky is an excellent example of children. They can even pick a few traits from him and start helping a family with groceries. And all this while playing a simple app, who would have thought. You will be happy with the result, and it will be noticeable. Children are entertained by gaining knowledge, and parents are delighted that their kids are learning something new. Install our app and see it for yourself.<br><br>About Mojo Mobiles Games:<br>It is our passion to make unique and educational games for kids. We combine creative and educational approaches to deliver the best for children and their parents.<br>We are happy to help parents to entertain and educate their kids by using modern approaches where gamification and teaching go together. We even go further and make beta tests in kindergartens with the exact target audience to deliver the best fitting games.<br><br>\ud83d\udce7 We are open to any suggestions and comments as we permanently improve our games.<br>Contact us at any time: studio@mojomobiles.games",

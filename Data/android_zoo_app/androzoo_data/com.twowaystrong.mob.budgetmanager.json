    "descriptionHtml": "The Two-way Strong Budget Manager makes it easy to send payments to registered computer users without the use of a credit card or the need to have a bank account. It can be used in an online scenario to send a payment to a friend or a relative in another country. It can also be used in an in-store scenario when the user doesn&#39;t have cash immediately on hand to complete a sales transaction. If there is a mistake, a regret, or a possible fraud, the user can send a timely request to cancel or dispute the payment. The other user in the transaction can review the request and send a timely response to accept or reject. Both users directly involved are informed. Unlike in a traditional banking operation, the user&#39;s financial record shows a positive or negative net balance. It is permissible to continue to send payments when the user&#39;s financial record falls below zero. The Two-way Strong Budget Manager continuously updates the user&#39;s general ledger to show the current balance and the overall health of the user&#39;s financial situation. The Two-way Strong Budget Manager requires the Two-way Strong User Authenticator for the user to have access to the features in the Budget Manager.<br><br>Features and Benefits<br><br>Online Peer-to-Peer Payment<br>A registered user can send and approve a payment to another registered user, regardless of where the two users are physically located.<br><br>In-store Peer-to-Peer Payment<br>A registered user can send essential payment data securely and directly from their mobile phone to the merchant&#39;s mobile device in a store or physical location (without Internet access).<br><br>Payment Life-cycle Notifications<br>The two persons involved in a payment transaction are kept informed regarding the payment&#39;s status at various stages and can accept or reject the payment.<br><br>Financial Record Review<br>A registered user can review their deposits, withdrawals, and net gain or loss for all payment transactions occurring at various stages of the payment life-cycle.<br><br>Financial Analysis<br>A registered user can review up-to-the-minute charts to spot irregularities in daily withdrawals and deposits and in user-configurable financial statistics.<br><br>Payment Control Mechanism<br>A registered user can apply specified limits to block payments during a specified time period, so that the user doesn&#39;t have to worry about spending too much or exceeding their household budget.<br><br>Convenient Payee List<br>Each new registered user to whom a payment is sent is associated with the payer and accessible only to the payer for review and making another payment.<br><br>Encrypted Stored Messaging Information<br>Just like with personal information, notification messages are encrypted and stored in an encrypted format on the remote computer servers.",

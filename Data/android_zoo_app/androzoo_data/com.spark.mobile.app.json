Video recordings of games and practices could be shared in real time between the coach, player, and parent, allowing for annotation and identification of problem areas. These recordings may also be used to assign drills and at-home workouts, as well as a gauge for a young athlete&#39;s noticeable growth that can be tracked over time.<br><br>RECORD. CONNECT. COLLEBRATE.<br><br><br>RECORD<br>Record practice and game videos to get expert advice from coaches and let recruiters know about your young all-star performance.<br><br>CONNECT<br>Share your videos with your coach and recruiters.

That\u2019s why Spark My Sport\u2019s mission is to connect coaches and players digitally, converting those often-unutilized moments off the court back into vital practice hours. We empower players, parents and coaches to know that drills are being run properly at home, skills are being improved and only good habits are being solidified.<br><br>VIRTUAL TRAINING JUST GOT A LOT MORE PERSONAL<br>Our app is designed by industry leaders in both the technology and personal training fields, blending the best of both worlds between functionality and intuitive UI.

All-star training isn\u2019t just for a privileged few\u2026 it should be for everyone.<br><br>BE YOUR OWN COMMENTATOR<br>Our broadcast and community functions allow players, parents and coaches to share their feats. Spark My Sport can host webcasts, podcasts and be used to post Vimeo recordings.<br><br>KEEP IT CLASSY ON &amp; OFF THE COURT<br>Cultivating healthy communication habits is critical to honing maturity and respect: two fundamental pillars of any sports program. In that regard, we want to help kids prepare for a life of good decision-making. When their profiles are ready for review by recruiters and talent scouts, their coaches can broadcast their skills far and wide.<br><br>TEAMWORK MEANS NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND<br>While our app is currently basketball-focused, we\u2019re growing to include other sports: baseball, volleyball and table tennis. Our already-impressive AI is growing by leaps and bounds every day and we\u2019ve got an eye for expanding to all sports played around the world.<br><br>DOWNLOAD SPARK MY SPORT<br>Spark My Sport is now on the iOS App store!

Dream big and achieve your full potential.<br>Spark my Sport is an online sports coaching platform that allows coaches to teach and offer virtual feedback to young players.

Video recordings of games and practices could be shared in real time between the coach, player, and parent, allowing for annotation and identification of problem areas. These recordings may also be used to assign drills and at-home workouts, as well as a gauge for a young athlete&#39;s noticeable growth that can be tracked over time.<br><br>RECORD. CONNECT. COLLEBRATE.<br><br><br>RECORD<br>Record practice and game videos to get expert advice from coaches and let recruiters know about your young all-star performance.<br><br>CONNECT<br>Share your videos with your coach and recruiters. Build your network to communicate privately among teammates, coaches, and recruiters.<br><br>COLLABORATE<br>Analyze your game&#39;s strengths and weaknesses, get performance insights, and collaborate with coaches on ways to improve.<br><br>ALL-STARS ARE MADE BETWEEN GAMES<br>Everyone knows all-star habits are made in the critical off-hours between games and practices, but not everyone has the benefit of a personal trainer. That\u2019s why Spark My Sport\u2019s mission is to connect coaches and players digitally, converting those often-unutilized moments off the court back into vital practice hours. We empower players, parents and coaches to know that drills are being run properly at home, skills are being improved and only good habits are being solidified.<br><br>VIRTUAL TRAINING JUST GOT A LOT MORE PERSONAL<br>Our app is designed by industry leaders in both the technology and personal training fields, blending the best of both worlds between functionality and intuitive UI. It\u2019s clean, easy and eliminates communication issues, putting valuable focus back on training. All-star training isn\u2019t just for a privileged few\u2026 it should be for everyone.<br><br>BE YOUR OWN COMMENTATOR<br>Our broadcast and community functions allow players, parents and coaches to share their feats. Spark My Sport can host webcasts, podcasts and be used to post Vimeo recordings.<br><br>KEEP IT CLASSY ON &amp; OFF THE COURT<br>Cultivating healthy communication habits is critical to honing maturity and respect: two fundamental pillars of any sports program. In that regard, we want to help kids prepare for a life of good decision-making. When their profiles are ready for review by recruiters and talent scouts, their coaches can broadcast their skills far and wide.<br><br>TEAMWORK MEANS NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND<br>While our app is currently basketball-focused, we\u2019re growing to include other sports: baseball, volleyball and table tennis. Our already-impressive AI is growing by leaps and bounds every day and we\u2019ve got an eye for expanding to all sports played around the world.<br><br>DOWNLOAD SPARK MY SPORT<br>Spark My Sport is now on the iOS App store! Take your training to the next level now by downloading the app.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Spark my Sport uses your phone to record games and practice sessions to get real time performance feedback. Dream big and achieve your full potential.<br>Spark my Sport is an online sports coaching platform that allows coaches to teach and offer virtual feedback to young players. With the best video skills training app, you can connect, record and challenge yourself to reach your fullest potential.

Video recordings of games and practices could be shared in real time between the coach, player, and parent, allowing for annotation and identification of problem areas. These recordings may also be used to assign drills and at-home workouts, as well as a gauge for a young athlete&#39;s noticeable growth that can be tracked over time.<br><br>RECORD. CONNECT. COLLEBRATE.<br><br><br>RECORD<br>Record practice and game videos to get expert advice from coaches and let recruiters know about your young all-star performance.<br><br>CONNECT<br>Share your videos with your coach and recruiters. Build your network to communicate privately among teammates, coaches, and recruiters.<br><br>COLLABORATE<br>Analyze your game&#39;s strengths and weaknesses, get performance insights, and collaborate with coaches on ways to improve.<br><br>ALL-STARS ARE MADE BETWEEN GAMES<br>Everyone knows all-star habits are made in the critical off-hours between games and practices, but not everyone has the benefit of a personal trainer. That\u2019s why Spark My Sport\u2019s mission is to connect coaches and players digitally, converting those often-unutilized moments off the court back into vital practice hours. We empower players, parents and coaches to know that drills are being run properly at home, skills are being improved and only good habits are being solidified.<br><br>VIRTUAL TRAINING JUST GOT A LOT MORE PERSONAL<br>Our app is designed by industry leaders in both the technology and personal training fields, blending the best of both worlds between functionality and intuitive UI. It\u2019s clean, easy and eliminates communication issues, putting valuable focus back on training. All-star training isn\u2019t just for a privileged few\u2026 it should be for everyone.<br><br>BE YOUR OWN COMMENTATOR<br>Our broadcast and community functions allow players, parents and coaches to share their feats. Spark My Sport can host webcasts, podcasts and be used to post Vimeo recordings.<br><br>KEEP IT CLASSY ON &amp; OFF THE COURT<br>Cultivating healthy communication habits is critical to honing maturity and respect: two fundamental pillars of any sports program. In that regard, we want to help kids prepare for a life of good decision-making. When their profiles are ready for review by recruiters and talent scouts, their coaches can broadcast their skills far and wide.<br><br>TEAMWORK MEANS NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND<br>While our app is currently basketball-focused, we\u2019re growing to include other sports: baseball, volleyball and table tennis. Our already-impressive AI is growing by leaps and bounds every day and we\u2019ve got an eye for expanding to all sports played around the world.<br><br>DOWNLOAD SPARK MY SPORT<br>Spark My Sport is now on the iOS App store! Take your training to the next level now by downloading the app.",

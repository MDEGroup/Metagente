Learning about light and adopting a great light &amp; sleep hygiene is integral to a healthy lifestyle in today&#39;s artificially illuminated world.<br><br>Becoming aware of solar dawn, sunrise &amp; sunset times is an important step on the way to a more natural lifestyle and biorhythm. Why not set a sunrise alarm or a reminder for the solar time when ultraviolet light (UVA or UVB) appears? You might wonder why this is of significance? You can find out about the relevance of UV light, the problems with artificial light and many other topics affecting your circadian clock in the learn section.<br><br>CIRCADIAN HELPS YOU LEARN &amp; IMPLEMENT<br>The comprehensive learning environment features a growing internal library plus tons of external resources from videos to research papers and blog articles. The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related. Circadian gives you the needed context fast while handing you all the practical implications for each topic on a silver platter.<br><br>Seasonal rhythms, smart sun exposure, sunscreen, sunglasses, grounding, infrared light, peak cognition, exercise, sunrise, solar noon, sunset are some of the topics covered. In no time, you can become an expert on your sleep rhythm, circadian rhythm fasting, blue blockers, natural light, and how it all ties together.<br><br>CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS \u2013 A BIT OF SCIENCE ON YOUR CIRCADIAN CLOCKS<br>Your body&#39;s circadian rhythms are 24-hour cycles of biological, hormonal, and behavioural patterns. This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your body&#39;s production of hormones that control your sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. At least 50% of human gene expression is under circadian clock control. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for your wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Trillions of circadian clocks in almost all of our cells regulate cellular functioning. All your circadian clocks need to collaborate to orchestrate your biology. Disruption of your circadian clock leads to chaos, inflammation and disease.<br><br>The primary controller of circadian rhythms is the natural light &amp; dark cycle\u2014this is where solar time comes in (think solar dawn, sunrise, sunset, etc.). To thrive you want to be nourishing, moving and resting your bodies in sync with natures cycles.<br><br>Your daily schedule ultimately determines your weight, energy levels, mood, clarity and overall health. Setting a daily schedule that reinforces your bodies circadian &amp; sleep rhythm is the most potent health habit you can adopt. Circadian helps you do precisely that.<br><br>Still doubtful?<br>Consider that circadian disruptions are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer? Don&#39;t believe it? Google: &quot;shift work&quot; or &quot;circadian rhythm&quot; plus the name of a disease.<br><br>Credits<br>Circadian wants to thank Dr Jack Kruse, Dr Alexander Wunsch and Dr Satchin Panda for their pioneering work. Without these brilliant doctors and many others, this solar clock circadian rhythm calculator app would not have been possible.",

Start sleeping, waking, eating, fasting, exercising and working when you are meant to.<br><br>The light you live under is affecting you more than you can imagine right now. Learning about light and adopting a great light &amp; sleep hygiene is integral to a healthy lifestyle in today&#39;s artificially illuminated world.<br><br>Becoming aware of solar dawn, sunrise &amp; sunset times is an important step on the way to a more natural lifestyle and biorhythm. Why not set a sunrise alarm or a reminder for the solar time when ultraviolet light (UVA or UVB) appears? You might wonder why this is of significance? You can find out about the relevance of UV light, the problems with artificial light and many other topics affecting your circadian clock in the learn section.<br><br>CIRCADIAN HELPS YOU LEARN &amp; IMPLEMENT<br>The comprehensive learning environment features a growing internal library plus tons of external resources from videos to research papers and blog articles. The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related. Circadian gives you the needed context fast while handing you all the practical implications for each topic on a silver platter.<br><br>Seasonal rhythms, smart sun exposure, sunscreen, sunglasses, grounding, infrared light, peak cognition, exercise, sunrise, solar noon, sunset are some of the topics covered. In no time, you can become an expert on your sleep rhythm, circadian rhythm fasting, blue blockers, natural light, and how it all ties together.<br><br>CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS \u2013 A BIT OF SCIENCE ON YOUR CIRCADIAN CLOCKS<br>Your body&#39;s circadian rhythms are 24-hour cycles of biological, hormonal, and behavioural patterns. This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your body&#39;s production of hormones that control your sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. At least 50% of human gene expression is under circadian clock control. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for your wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Trillions of circadian clocks in almost all of our cells regulate cellular functioning. All your circadian clocks need to collaborate to orchestrate your biology. Disruption of your circadian clock leads to chaos, inflammation and disease.<br><br>Your daily schedule ultimately determines your weight, energy levels, mood, clarity and overall health. Setting a daily schedule that reinforces your bodies circadian &amp; sleep rhythm is the most potent health habit you can adopt. Circadian helps you do precisely that.<br><br>Still doubtful?<br>Consider that circadian disruptions are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer? Don&#39;t believe it? Google: &quot;shift work&quot; or &quot;circadian rhythm&quot; plus the name of a disease.<br><br>Free or paid?<br>Circadian offers a 7-day free trial period with some functionality and content restricted. To unlock all features and content you need to subscribe or purchase the app.<br><br>Credits<br>Circadian wants to thank Dr Jack Kruse, Dr Alexander Wunsch and Dr Satchin Panda for their pioneering work. Without these brilliant doctors and many others, this solar clock circadian rhythm calculator app would not have been possible.",

Learning about light and adopting a great light &amp; sleep hygiene is integral to a healthy lifestyle in today&#39;s artificially illuminated world.<br><br>Becoming aware of solar dawn, sunrise &amp; sunset times is an important step on the way to a more natural lifestyle and biorhythm. Why not set a sunrise alarm or a reminder for the solar time when ultraviolet light (UVA or UVB) appears? You might wonder why this is of significance? You can find out about the relevance of UV light, the problems with artificial light and many other topics affecting your circadian clock in the learn section.<br><br>CIRCADIAN HELPS YOU LEARN &amp; IMPLEMENT<br>The comprehensive learning environment features a growing internal library plus tons of external resources from videos to research papers and blog articles. The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related. Circadian gives you the needed context fast while handing you all the practical implications for each topic on a silver platter.<br><br>Seasonal rhythms, smart sun exposure, sunscreen, sunglasses, grounding, infrared light, peak cognition, exercise, sunrise, solar noon, sunset are some of the topics covered. In no time, you can become an expert on your sleep rhythm, circadian rhythm fasting, blue blockers, natural light, and how it all ties together.<br><br>CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS \u2013 A BIT OF SCIENCE ON YOUR CIRCADIAN CLOCKS<br>Your body&#39;s circadian rhythms are 24-hour cycles of biological, hormonal, and behavioural patterns. This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your body&#39;s production of hormones that control your sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. At least 50% of human gene expression is under circadian clock control. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for your wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Trillions of circadian clocks in almost all of our cells regulate cellular functioning. All your circadian clocks need to collaborate to orchestrate your biology. Disruption of your circadian clock leads to chaos, inflammation and disease.<br><br>Your daily schedule ultimately determines your weight, energy levels, mood, clarity and overall health. Setting a daily schedule that reinforces your bodies circadian &amp; sleep rhythm is the most potent health habit you can adopt. Circadian helps you do precisely that.<br><br>Still doubtful?<br>Consider that circadian disruptions are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer? Don&#39;t believe it?

Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body - aka circadian rhythms or the power of &#39;when&#39;. \u23f0<br><br>Enter <b>Circadian, your app for applying circadian rhythms, and living a more natural lifestyle</b>. Circadian uses your local solar time and some user settings to calculate your circadian rhythms, also known as biorhythm.<br><br>\u258c<b>Set reminders and alarms for critical circadian events</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>Being a biorhythm calculator, Circadian provides you with reminders &amp; alarms to operate on your optimal biological schedule.

Circadian can adjust your sleep duration dynamically based on the changing light conditions at your location. This keeps your bodies biorhythm in sync with seasonal changes.<br><br>\u258c<b>Feast and fast in line with natures pulse</b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Optimise your eating times and upgrade your intermittent fasting routine to a whole new level. Eating and fasting in sync with circadian and ultradian rhythms (less than a day) is essential if you want to reverse a metabolic disease or avoid getting one in the first place.<br><br>\u258c<b>Learn and implement with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for your wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm. Learn more in the app.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions, and the ensuing inflammation, are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for your wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for your wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm. Learn more in the app.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions, and the ensuing inflammation, are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer.

Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body - aka circadian rhythms or the power of &#39;when&#39;. \u23f0<br><br>Enter <b>Circadian, your app for applying circadian rhythms, and living a more natural lifestyle</b>. Circadian uses your local solar time and some user settings to calculate your circadian rhythms, also known as biorhythm.<br><br>\u258c<b>Set reminders and alarms for critical circadian events</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>Being a biorhythm calculator, Circadian provides you with reminders &amp; alarms to operate on your optimal biological schedule. Start sleeping, waking, eating, fasting, exercising and working when you are meant to. Set reminders or alarms for<br>\u25cb solar times (daybreak, sunrise, solar noon, sunset, nightfall)<br>\u25cb ultraviolet light rise and fall (UVA/UVB)<br>\u25cb sleep and wake times as well as a digital sunset<br>\u25cb eating and fasting times as well as meal timings<br>\u25cb morning and peak exercise times<br>\u25cb peak cognition times<br><br>\u258c<b>Adjust your sleep with the seasons</b>\ud83d\udca4 <br>Circadian rhythms govern daily functioning, whereas seasonal rhythms, also referred to as infradian rhythms, affect longer-term behavioural and metabolic changes. Circadian can adjust your sleep duration dynamically based on the changing light conditions at your location. This keeps your bodies biorhythm in sync with seasonal changes.<br><br>\u258c<b>Feast and fast in line with natures pulse</b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Optimise your eating times and upgrade your intermittent fasting routine to a whole new level. Eating and fasting in sync with circadian and ultradian rhythms (less than a day) is essential if you want to reverse a metabolic disease or avoid getting one in the first place.<br><br>\u258c<b>Learn and implement with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for your wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm. Learn more in the app.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions, and the ensuing inflammation, are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for your wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm.

Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body - aka circadian rhythms or the power of &#39;when&#39;. \u23f0<br><br>Enter <b>Circadian, your app for applying circadian rhythms, and living a more natural lifestyle</b>. Circadian uses your local solar time and some user settings to calculate your circadian rhythms, also known as biorhythm.<br><br>\u258c<b>Set reminders and alarms for critical circadian events</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>Being a biorhythm calculator, Circadian provides you with reminders &amp; alarms to operate on your optimal biological schedule. Start sleeping, waking, eating, fasting, exercising and working when you are meant to. Set reminders or alarms for<br>\u25cb solar times (daybreak, sunrise, solar noon, sunset, nightfall)<br>\u25cb ultraviolet light rise and fall (UVA/UVB)<br>\u25cb sleep and wake times as well as a digital sunset<br>\u25cb eating and fasting times as well as meal timings<br>\u25cb morning and peak exercise times<br>\u25cb peak cognition times<br><br>\u258c<b>Adjust your sleep with the seasons</b>\ud83d\udca4 <br>Circadian rhythms govern daily functioning, whereas seasonal rhythms, also referred to as infradian rhythms, affect longer-term behavioural and metabolic changes. Circadian can adjust your sleep duration dynamically based on the changing light conditions at your location. This keeps your bodies biorhythm in sync with seasonal changes.<br><br>\u258c<b>Feast and fast in line with natures pulse</b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Optimise your eating times and upgrade your intermittent fasting routine to a whole new level. Eating and fasting in sync with circadian and ultradian rhythms (less than a day) is essential if you want to reverse a metabolic disease or avoid getting one in the first place.<br><br>\u258c<b>Learn and implement with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for your wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm. Learn more in the app.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions, and the ensuing inflammation, are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer.

Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body - aka circadian rhythms or the power of &#39;when&#39;. \u23f0<br><br>Enter <b>Circadian, your app for applying circadian rhythms, and living a more natural lifestyle</b>. Circadian uses your local solar time and some user settings to calculate your circadian rhythms, also known as biorhythm.<br><br>\u258c<b>Set reminders and alarms for critical circadian events</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>Being a biorhythm calculator, Circadian provides you with reminders &amp; alarms to operate on your optimal biological schedule.

Set reminders or alarms for<br>\u25cb solar times (daybreak, sunrise, solar noon, sunset, nightfall)<br>\u25cb ultraviolet light rise and fall (UVA/UVB)<br>\u25cb sleep and wake times as well as a digital sunset<br>\u25cb eating and fasting times as well as meal timings<br>\u25cb morning and peak exercise times<br>\u25cb peak cognition times<br><br>\u258c<b>Adjust your sleep with the seasons</b>\ud83d\udca4 <br>Circadian rhythms govern daily functioning, whereas seasonal rhythms, also referred to as infradian rhythms, affect longer-term behavioural and metabolic changes. Circadian can adjust your sleep duration dynamically based on the changing light conditions at your location. This keeps your bodies biorhythm in sync with seasonal changes.<br><br>\u258c<b>Feast and fast in line with natures pulse</b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Optimise your eating times and upgrade your intermittent fasting routine to a whole new level. Eating and fasting in sync with circadian and ultradian rhythms (less than a day) is essential if you want to reverse a metabolic disease or avoid getting one in the first place.<br><br>\u258c<b>Learn and implement with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for your wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm. Learn more in the app.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions, and the ensuing inflammation, are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer.

Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body - aka circadian rhythms or the power of &#39;when&#39;. \u23f0<br><br>Enter <b>Circadian, your app for applying circadian rhythms, and living a more natural lifestyle</b>. Circadian uses your local solar time and some user settings to calculate your circadian rhythms, also known as biorhythm.<br><br>\u258c<b>Set reminders and alarms for critical circadian events</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>Being a biorhythm calculator, Circadian provides you with reminders &amp; alarms to operate on your optimal biological schedule.

Circadian can adjust your sleep duration dynamically based on the changing light conditions at your location. This keeps your bodies biorhythm in sync with seasonal changes.<br><br>\u258c<b>Feast and fast in line with natures pulse</b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Optimise your eating times and upgrade your intermittent fasting routine to a whole new level. Eating and fasting in sync with circadian and ultradian rhythms (less than a day) is essential if you want to reverse a metabolic disease or avoid getting one in the first place.<br><br>\u258c<b>Learn and implement with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for your wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm. Learn more in the app.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions, and the ensuing inflammation, are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for your wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for your wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions.

Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body - aka circadian rhythms or the power of &#39;when&#39;. \u23f0<br><br>Enter <b>Circadian, your app for applying circadian rhythms, and living a more natural lifestyle</b>. Circadian uses your local solar time and some user settings to calculate your circadian rhythms, also known as biorhythm.<br><br>\u258c<b>Set reminders and alarms for critical circadian events</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>Being a biorhythm calculator, Circadian provides you with reminders &amp; alarms to operate on your optimal biological schedule. Start sleeping, waking, eating, fasting, exercising and working when you are meant to. Set reminders or alarms for<br>\u25cb solar times (daybreak, sunrise, solar noon, sunset, nightfall)<br>\u25cb ultraviolet light rise and fall (UVA/UVB)<br>\u25cb sleep and wake times as well as a digital sunset<br>\u25cb eating and fasting times as well as meal timings<br>\u25cb morning and peak exercise times<br>\u25cb peak cognition times<br><br>\u258c<b>Adjust your sleep with the seasons</b>\ud83d\udca4 <br>Circadian rhythms govern daily functioning, whereas seasonal rhythms, also referred to as infradian rhythms, affect longer-term behavioural and metabolic changes. Circadian can adjust your sleep duration dynamically based on the changing light conditions at your location. This keeps your bodies biorhythm in sync with seasonal changes.<br><br>\u258c<b>Feast and fast in line with natures pulse</b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Optimise your eating times and upgrade your intermittent fasting routine to a whole new level. Eating and fasting in sync with circadian and ultradian rhythms (less than a day) is essential if you want to reverse a metabolic disease or avoid getting one in the first place.<br><br>\u258c<b>Learn and implement with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for your wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm. Learn more in the app.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions, and the ensuing inflammation, are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer.

Search: &quot;shift work&quot; or &quot;circadian rhythm&quot; plus the name of a disease.<br><br>\u258c<b>What does Circadian cost?</b> \ud83d\udcb5<br>Circadian offers a 7-day free trial period with some functionality and content restricted. You can continue using Circadian after the free trial with further limitations.

As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for your wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions.

Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body - aka circadian rhythms or the power of &#39;when&#39;. \u23f0<br><br>Enter <b>Circadian, your app for applying circadian rhythms, and living a more natural lifestyle</b>. Circadian uses your local solar time and some user settings to calculate your circadian rhythms, also known as biorhythm.<br><br>\u258c<b>Set reminders and alarms for critical circadian events</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>Being a biorhythm calculator, Circadian provides you with reminders &amp; alarms to operate on your optimal biological schedule. Start sleeping, waking, eating, fasting, exercising and working when you are meant to. Set reminders or alarms for<br>\u25cb solar times (daybreak, sunrise, solar noon, sunset, nightfall)<br>\u25cb ultraviolet light rise and fall (UVA/UVB)<br>\u25cb sleep and wake times as well as a digital sunset<br>\u25cb eating and fasting times as well as meal timings<br>\u25cb morning and peak exercise times<br>\u25cb peak cognition times<br><br>\u258c<b>Adjust your sleep with the seasons</b>\ud83d\udca4 <br>Circadian rhythms govern daily functioning, whereas seasonal rhythms, also referred to as infradian rhythms, affect longer-term behavioural and metabolic changes. Circadian can adjust your sleep duration dynamically based on the changing light conditions at your location. This keeps your bodies biorhythm in sync with seasonal changes.<br><br>\u258c<b>Feast and fast in line with natures pulse</b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Optimise your eating times and upgrade your intermittent fasting routine to a whole new level. Eating and fasting in sync with circadian and ultradian rhythms (less than a day) is essential if you want to reverse a metabolic disease or avoid getting one in the first place.<br><br>\u258c<b>Learn and implement with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for your wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm. Learn more in the app.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions, and the ensuing inflammation, are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer.

Search: &quot;shift work&quot; or &quot;circadian rhythm&quot; plus the name of a disease.<br><br>\u258c<b>What does Circadian cost?</b> \ud83d\udcb5<br>Circadian offers a 7-day free trial period with some functionality and content restricted. You can continue using Circadian after the free trial with further limitations.

Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body - aka circadian rhythms or the power of &#39;when&#39;. \u23f0<br><br>Enter <b>Circadian, your app for applying circadian rhythms, and living a more natural lifestyle</b>. Circadian uses your local solar time and some user settings to calculate your circadian rhythms, also known as biorhythm.<br><br>\u258c<b>Set reminders and alarms for critical circadian events</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>Being a biorhythm calculator, Circadian provides you with reminders &amp; alarms to operate on your optimal biological schedule.

Circadian can adjust your sleep duration dynamically based on the changing light conditions at your location. This keeps your bodies biorhythm in sync with seasonal changes.<br><br>\u258c<b>Feast and fast in line with natures pulse</b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Optimise your eating times and upgrade your intermittent fasting routine to a whole new level. Eating and fasting in sync with circadian and ultradian rhythms (less than a day) is essential if you want to reverse a metabolic disease or avoid getting one in the first place.<br><br>\u258c<b>Learn and implement with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm. Learn more in the app.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions, and the ensuing inflammation, are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm.

Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body - aka circadian rhythms or the power of &#39;when&#39;. \u23f0<br><br>Enter <b>Circadian, your app for applying circadian rhythms, and living a more natural lifestyle</b>. Circadian uses your local solar time and some user settings to calculate your circadian rhythms, also known as biorhythm.<br><br>\u258c<b>Set reminders and alarms for critical circadian events</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>Being a biorhythm calculator, Circadian provides you with reminders &amp; alarms to operate on your optimal biological schedule. Apply the future of lifestyle medicine today. Start sleeping, waking, eating, exercising and working when you are meant to.

Circadian can adjust your sleep duration dynamically based on the changing light conditions at your location. This keeps your bodies biorhythm in sync with seasonal changes.<br><br>\u258c<b>Feast and fast in line with natures pulse</b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Optimise your eating times and upgrade your intermittent fasting routine to a whole new level. Eating and fasting in sync with circadian and ultradian rhythms (less than a day) is essential if you want to reverse a metabolic disease or avoid getting one in the first place.<br><br>\u258c<b>Learn and implement with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm. Learn more in the app.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions, and the ensuing inflammation, are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer.

Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body - aka circadian rhythms or the power of &#39;when&#39;. \u23f0<br><br>Enter <b>Circadian, your app for applying circadian rhythms, and living a more natural lifestyle</b>. Circadian uses your local solar time and some user settings to calculate your circadian rhythms, also known as biorhythm.<br><br>\u258c<b>Set reminders and alarms for critical circadian events</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>Being a biorhythm calculator, Circadian provides you with reminders &amp; alarms to operate on your optimal biological schedule. Apply the future of lifestyle medicine today. Start sleeping, waking, eating, exercising and working when you are meant to. Set reminders or alarms for<br>\u25cb solar times (daybreak, sunrise, solar noon, sunset, nightfall)<br>\u25cb ultraviolet light rise and fall (UVA/UVB)<br>\u25cb sleep and wake times as well as a digital sunset<br>\u25cb eating and fasting times as well as meal timings<br>\u25cb morning and peak exercise times<br>\u25cb peak cognition times<br><br>\u258c<b>Adjust your sleep with the seasons</b>\ud83d\udca4 <br>Circadian rhythms govern daily functioning, whereas seasonal rhythms, also referred to as infradian rhythms, affect longer-term behavioural and metabolic changes. Circadian can adjust your sleep duration dynamically based on the changing light conditions at your location. This keeps your bodies biorhythm in sync with seasonal changes.<br><br>\u258c<b>Feast and fast in line with natures pulse</b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Optimise your eating times and upgrade your intermittent fasting routine to a whole new level. Eating and fasting in sync with circadian and ultradian rhythms (less than a day) is essential if you want to reverse a metabolic disease or avoid getting one in the first place.<br><br>\u258c<b>Learn and implement with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm. Learn more in the app.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions, and the ensuing inflammation, are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer. Don&#39;t believe it? Search: &quot;shift work&quot; or &quot;circadian rhythm&quot; plus the name of a disease.<br><br>\u258c<b>What does Circadian cost?</b> \ud83d\udcb5<br>Circadian offers a 7-day free trial period with some functionality and content restricted. You can continue using Circadian after the free trial with further limitations.

Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body - aka circadian rhythms or the power of &#39;when&#39;. \u23f0<br><br>Enter <b>Circadian, your app for applying circadian rhythms, and living a more natural lifestyle</b>. Circadian uses your local solar time and some user settings to calculate your circadian rhythms, also known as biorhythm.<br><br>\u258c<b>Set reminders and alarms for critical circadian events</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>Being a biorhythm calculator, Circadian provides you with reminders &amp; alarms to operate on your optimal biological schedule. Apply the future of lifestyle medicine today. Start sleeping, waking, eating, exercising and working when you are meant to. Set reminders or alarms for<br>\u25cb solar times (daybreak, sunrise, solar noon, sunset, nightfall)<br>\u25cb ultraviolet light rise and fall (UVA/UVB)<br>\u25cb sleep and wake times as well as a digital sunset<br>\u25cb eating and fasting times as well as meal timings<br>\u25cb morning and peak exercise times<br>\u25cb peak cognition times<br><br>\u258c<b>Adjust your sleep with the seasons</b>\ud83d\udca4 <br>Circadian rhythms govern daily functioning, whereas seasonal rhythms, also referred to as infradian rhythms, affect longer-term behavioural and metabolic changes. Circadian can adjust your sleep duration dynamically based on the changing light conditions at your location. This keeps your bodies biorhythm in sync with seasonal changes.<br><br>\u258c<b>Feast and fast in line with natures pulse</b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Optimise your eating times and upgrade your intermittent fasting routine to a whole new level. Eating and fasting in sync with circadian and ultradian rhythms (less than a day) is essential if you want to reverse a metabolic disease or avoid getting one in the first place.<br><br>\u258c<b>Learn and implement with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm. Learn more in the app.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions, and the ensuing inflammation, are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer. Don&#39;t believe it? Search: &quot;shift work&quot; or &quot;circadian rhythm&quot; plus the name of a disease.<br><br>\u258c<b>What does Circadian cost?</b> \ud83d\udcb5<br>Circadian offers a 7-day free trial period with some functionality and content restricted. You can continue using Circadian after the free trial with further limitations.

Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body - aka circadian rhythms or the power of &#39;when&#39;. \u23f0<br><br>Enter <b>Circadian, your app for applying circadian rhythms, and living a more natural lifestyle</b>. Circadian uses your local solar time and some user settings to calculate your circadian rhythms, also known as biorhythm.<br><br>\u258c<b>Set reminders and alarms for critical circadian events</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>Being a biorhythm calculator, Circadian provides you with reminders &amp; alarms to operate on your optimal biological schedule. Apply the future of lifestyle medicine today. Start sleeping, waking, eating, exercising and working when you are meant to. Set reminders or alarms for<br>\u25cb solar times (daybreak, sunrise, solar noon, sunset, nightfall)<br>\u25cb ultraviolet light rise and fall (UVA/UVB)<br>\u25cb sleep and wake times as well as a digital sunset<br>\u25cb eating and fasting times as well as meal timings<br>\u25cb morning and peak exercise times<br>\u25cb peak cognition times<br><br>\u258c<b>Adjust your sleep with the seasons</b>\ud83d\udca4 <br>Circadian rhythms govern daily functioning, whereas seasonal rhythms, also referred to as infradian rhythms, affect longer-term behavioural and metabolic changes. Circadian can adjust your sleep duration dynamically based on the changing light conditions at your location. This keeps your bodies biorhythm in sync with seasonal changes.<br><br>\u258c<b>Feast and fast in line with natures pulse</b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Optimise your eating times and upgrade your intermittent fasting routine to a whole new level. Eating and fasting in sync with circadian and ultradian rhythms (less than a day) is essential if you want to reverse a metabolic disease or avoid getting one in the first place.<br><br>\u258c<b>Learn and implement with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm. Learn more in the app.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions, and the ensuing inflammation, are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer.

You can continue using Circadian after the free trial with further limitations.

Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body - aka circadian rhythms or the power of &#39;when&#39;. \u23f0<br><br>Enter <b>Circadian, your app for applying circadian rhythms, and living a more natural lifestyle</b>. Circadian uses your local solar time and some user settings to calculate your circadian rhythms, also known as biorhythm.<br><br>\u258c<b>Set reminders and alarms for critical circadian events</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>Being a biorhythm calculator, Circadian provides you with reminders &amp; alarms to operate on your optimal biological schedule. Apply the future of lifestyle medicine today. Start sleeping, waking, eating, exercising and working when you are meant to. Set reminders or alarms for<br>\u25cb solar times (daybreak, sunrise, solar noon, sunset, nightfall)<br>\u25cb ultraviolet light rise and fall (UVA/UVB)<br>\u25cb sleep and wake times as well as a digital sunset<br>\u25cb eating and fasting times as well as meal timings<br>\u25cb morning and peak exercise times<br>\u25cb peak cognition times<br><br>\u258c<b>Adjust your sleep with the seasons</b>\ud83d\udca4 <br>Circadian rhythms govern daily functioning, whereas seasonal rhythms, also referred to as infradian rhythms, affect longer-term behavioural and metabolic changes. Circadian can adjust your sleep duration dynamically based on the changing light conditions at your location. This keeps your bodies biorhythm in sync with seasonal changes.<br><br>\u258c<b>Feast and fast in line with natures pulse</b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Optimise your eating times and upgrade your intermittent fasting routine to a whole new level. Eating and fasting in sync with circadian and ultradian rhythms (less than a day) is essential if you want to reverse a metabolic disease or avoid getting one in the first place.<br><br>\u258c<b>Learn and implement with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm. Learn more in the app.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions, and the ensuing inflammation, are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer. Don&#39;t believe it? Search: &quot;shift work&quot; or &quot;circadian rhythm&quot; plus the name of a disease.<br><br>\u258c<b>What does Circadian cost?</b> \ud83d\udcb5<br>Circadian offers a 7-day free trial period with some functionality and content restricted. You can continue using Circadian after the free trial with further limitations.

Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body - aka circadian rhythms or the power of &#39;when&#39;. \u23f0<br><br>Enter <b>Circadian, your app for applying circadian rhythms, and living a more natural lifestyle</b>. Circadian uses your local solar time and some user settings to calculate your circadian rhythms, also known as biorhythm.<br><br>\u258c<b>Set reminders and alarms for critical circadian events</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>Being a biorhythm calculator, Circadian provides you with reminders &amp; alarms to operate on your optimal biological schedule. Apply the future of lifestyle medicine today. Start sleeping, waking, eating, exercising and working when you are meant to.

Circadian can adjust your sleep duration dynamically based on the changing light conditions at your location. This keeps your bodies biorhythm in sync with seasonal changes.<br><br>\u258c<b>Feast and fast in line with natures pulse</b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Optimise your eating times and upgrade your intermittent fasting routine to a whole new level. Eating and fasting in sync with circadian and ultradian rhythms (less than a day) is essential if you want to reverse a metabolic disease or avoid getting one in the first place.<br><br>\u258c<b>Learn and implement with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm. Learn more in the app.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions, and the ensuing inflammation, are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer.

Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body - aka circadian rhythms or the power of &#39;when&#39;. \u23f0<br><br>Enter <b>Circadian, your app for applying circadian rhythms, and living a more natural lifestyle</b>. Circadian uses your local solar time and some user settings to calculate your circadian rhythms, also known as biorhythm.<br><br>\u258c<b>Set reminders and alarms for critical circadian events</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>Being a biorhythm calculator, Circadian provides you with reminders &amp; alarms to operate on your optimal biological schedule. Apply the future of lifestyle medicine today. Start sleeping, waking, eating, exercising and working when you are meant to. Set reminders or alarms for<br>\u25cb solar times (daybreak, sunrise, solar noon, sunset, nightfall)<br>\u25cb ultraviolet light rise and fall (UVA/UVB)<br>\u25cb sleep and wake times as well as a digital sunset<br>\u25cb eating and fasting times as well as meal timings<br>\u25cb morning and peak exercise times<br>\u25cb peak cognition times<br><br>\u258c<b>Adjust your sleep with the seasons</b>\ud83d\udca4 <br>Circadian rhythms govern daily functioning, whereas seasonal rhythms, also referred to as infradian rhythms, affect longer-term behavioural and metabolic changes. Circadian can adjust your sleep duration dynamically based on the changing light conditions at your location. This keeps your bodies biorhythm in sync with seasonal changes.<br><br>\u258c<b>Feast and fast in line with natures pulse</b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Optimise your eating times and upgrade your intermittent fasting routine to a whole new level. Eating and fasting in sync with circadian and ultradian rhythms (less than a day) is essential if you want to reverse a metabolic disease or avoid getting one in the first place.<br><br>\u258c<b>Learn and implement with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm related.

This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, circadian rhythmicity has profound implications for wellbeing and longevity.<br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br>Artificial light or &quot;junk light&quot; is the main culprit for circadian disruptions. Which is why more natural light exposure, especially at sunrise and sunset, is crucial to reset and tune your biorhythm. Learn more in the app.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions, and the ensuing inflammation, are linked to almost every modern disease from diabetes to cancer. Don&#39;t believe it? Search: &quot;shift work&quot; or &quot;circadian rhythm&quot; plus the name of a disease.<br><br>\u258c<b>What does Circadian cost?</b> \ud83d\udcb5<br>Circadian offers a 7-day free trial period with some functionality and content restricted. You can continue using Circadian after the free trial with further limitations.

    "descriptionHtml": "Ready for a <b>lifestyle that prioritises health and wellness</b>? <br>Ready for <b>living with more energy and focus</b>? <br>Keen to <b>have better sleep, improve mood and body composition</b>?<br><br>The answer? Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body. <br>Sync your lifestyle to nature to optimise your circadian rhythms and health.<br><br>\u258c<b>Circadian rhythms, biorhythms &amp; chronobiology: the science</b>\ud83d\udd2c<br><br>Your body&#39;s circadian rhythms are 24-hour cycles of biological, hormonal, and behavioural patterns. This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones, sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, your circadian rhythm has profound implications for wellbeing and longevity. <br><br>The 2017 Nobel price in medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clock chaos, inflammation and disease are the natural consequence.<br><br><b>Circadian is your wellness app for living harmoniously with the natural cycles.</b>. Circadian uses local solar times (ie sunrise and sunset time) plus user settings to calculate your circadian rhythm, also known as biorhythm. Think of it as your daily planner &amp; alarm clock for better sleep and health.<br><br>\u258c<b>Set reminders and alarms for critical circadian events</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>In line with natural cycles, Circadian provides you with reminders &amp; alarms to operate on your optimal biological schedule. Tweak your lifestyle with this wellness app. Start syncing your sleep cycle with nature and be active when you are meant to. Use Circadian as a daily schedule &amp; alarm clock for:<br>\u25cb daybreak, sunrise, solar noon, sunset and nightfall<br>\u25cb ultraviolet light rise and fall (UVA and UVB)<br>\u25cb sleep and wake times (align your sleep cycle with nature)<br>\u25cb natural eating and fasting <br>\u25cb morning and peak exercise<br>\u25cb peak cognition<br><br>\u258c<b>Adjust your sleep with the seasons</b>\ud83d\udca4 <br>Your biorhythm governs daily functioning, while seasonal rhythms affect longer-term behavioural &amp; metabolic changes. Circadian adjusts your sleep duration dynamically based on your location. Let your biorhythm become the daily planner that keeps you ontime with natural cycles and leads to better sleep. This way, you entrain your circadian rhythm and sleep cycle naturally. Think of Circadian as \u201cMy wellness app\u201d.<br><br>\u258c<b>Include fasting in your daily schedule</b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Aligning you eating time with circadian rhythms is essential to lowering inflammation, preventing/reversing disease and better sleep. Sunshine hours as well as sunset time can become your guide for when to eat and when to fast. Only eating within daylight hours is a powerful lifestyle habit instrumental for mywellness and better sleep. <br><br>\u258c<b>Understand and learn with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>The learn section provides you with carefully curated content on all things circadian rhythm, sunshine, better sleep and more. In-depth content, practical suggestions &amp; many surprises are waiting for you. <br>Learn about sunshine, uva, uvb, red &amp; infrared light, melatonin, blue blockers, social jetlag, better sleep &amp; much more.<br>Browse hundreds of articles, studies &amp; videos at your leisure.

    "descriptionHtml": "Ready for a <b>lifestyle that prioritises health and wellness</b>? <br>Ready for <b>living with more energy and focus</b>? <br>Keen to <b>have better sleep, improve mood and body composition</b>?<br>How about balancing your hormones naturally (via light and intermittent fasting)?<br><br>The answer? Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body. <br>Anchor your life to sunrise and sunset to optimise your circadian rhythm and natural cycles.<br><br>\u258c<b>Circadian rhythm, biorhythm &amp; chronobiology: the science</b>\ud83d\udd2c<br><br>Your body&#39;s circadian rhythm are 24-hour cycles of biological, hormonal, and behavioural patterns. This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones (i.e. melatonin), sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, your circadian rhythm has profound implications for well-being and longevity. <br><br>The 2017 Nobel prize in Medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks, chaos, inflammation, and disease are consequences. <br><br>Circadian is your natural alarm clock. Circadian uses local times (i.e. sunrise and sunset) plus user settings to calculate your circadian rhythm, also known as biorhythm. Optimize light, exercise and food timing to finally live better. Harmonize your life with the natural cycles, and let yourself be surprised! <br><br>\u258c<b>An alarm clock for critical circadian events to live well</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>In line with natural cycles, like light &amp; dark and the seasons, Circadian acts as an alarm clock for your optimal biorhythm. Start syncing your sleep cycle with nature and be active when you are meant to. Set reminders &amp; alarms for:<br>\u25cb daybreak, sunrise, solar noon, sunset and nightfall<br>\u25cb ultraviolet light rise and fall (UV)<br>\u25cb sleep and wake times<br>\u25cb natural eating and fasting <br>\u25cb morning and peak exercise<br>\u25cb peak cognition<br><br>\u258c<b>Adjust your sleep with the seasons</b>\ud83d\udca4 <br>Your biorhythms govern daily functioning, while seasonal rhythms affect longer-term behavioural &amp; metabolic changes. Circadian adjusts your sleep duration dynamically based on the sunshine hours at your location. Let your biorhythm become the alarm clock that keeps you in sync with natural cycles, balances hormones (ie cortisol &amp; melatonin), and leads to better sleep.<br><br>\u258c<b>Include fasting in your daily schedule </b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Eating and fasting are important cues for your biorhythm. Aligning your eating time with circadian rhythms is essential to balancing hormones, lowering inflammation, preventing/reversing disease and better sleep. Let light and sunshine be your guide (alarm clock) for eating and fasting.<br><br>\u258c<b>Understand and learn with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>Why you need UV light to make melatonin?<br>Why is sunshine essential for your hormonal balance and health?<br>Why should your alarm clock be ideally linked to sunrise?<br>What fasting times support your circadian rhythm, hormones and sleep?<br>Find these and many other answers with Circadian!<br>The learn section provides carefully curated in-depth content, practical suggestions &amp; many surprises.<br>Learn about circadian rhythm, light (sunshine, UV, red/infrared &amp; artificial light), melatonin, sleep, natural cycles &amp; much more.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions are linked to almost every modern disease, from diabetes to cancer. Don&#39;t believe it? Search: &quot;shift work&quot; or &quot;circadian rhythm&quot; plus a disease name.<br><br>\u258c<b>What does Circadian cost?</b> \ud83d\udcb5<br>Circadian offers a 7-day free trial + a limited free version after that. Prices for the full version vary based on the country/region.<br><br>\ud83d\udc9a Set your sunrise &amp; sunset alarm clock, bathe in more natural light, make the nights dark again, build strong natural cycles and experience harmony with your environment. <br>\u26a1  Light up your day and optimise circadian rhythm, biorhythm, natural cycles and health naturally.<br>\ud83c\udf05  <b>Download Circadian now!</b>",

    "descriptionHtml": "Ready for a <b>lifestyle that prioritises health and wellness</b>? <br>Ready for <b>living with more energy and focus</b>? <br>Keen to <b>have better sleep, improve mood and body composition</b>?<br>How about balancing your hormones naturally (via light and intermittent fasting)?<br><br>The answer? Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body. <br>Anchor your life to sunrise and sunset to optimise your circadian rhythm and natural cycles.<br><br>\u258c<b>Circadian rhythm, biorhythm &amp; chronobiology: the science</b>\ud83d\udd2c<br><br>Your body&#39;s circadian rhythm are 24-hour cycles of biological, hormonal, and behavioural patterns. This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones (i.e. melatonin), sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, your circadian rhythm has profound implications for well-being and longevity. <br><br>The 2017 Nobel prize in Medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks, chaos, inflammation, and disease are consequences. <br><br>Circadian is your natural alarm clock. Circadian uses local times (i.e. sunrise and sunset) plus user settings to calculate your circadian rhythm, also known as biorhythm. Optimize light, exercise and food timing to finally live better. Harmonize your life with the natural cycles, and let yourself be surprised! <br><br>\u258c<b>An alarm clock for critical circadian events to live well</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>In line with natural cycles, like light &amp; dark and the seasons, Circadian acts as an alarm clock for your optimal biorhythm. Start syncing your sleep cycle with nature and be active when you are meant to. Set reminders &amp; alarms for:<br>\u25cb daybreak, sunrise, solar noon, sunset and nightfall<br>\u25cb ultraviolet light rise and fall (UV)<br>\u25cb sleep and wake times<br>\u25cb natural eating and fasting <br>\u25cb morning and peak exercise<br>\u25cb peak cognition<br><br>\u258c<b>Adjust your sleep with the seasons</b>\ud83d\udca4 <br>Your biorhythms govern daily functioning, while seasonal rhythms affect longer-term behavioural &amp; metabolic changes. Circadian adjusts your sleep duration dynamically based on the sunshine hours at your location. Let your biorhythm become the alarm clock that keeps you in sync with natural cycles, balances hormones (ie cortisol &amp; melatonin), and leads to better sleep.<br><br>\u258c<b>Include fasting in your daily schedule </b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Eating and fasting are important cues for your biorhythm. Aligning your eating time with circadian rhythms is essential to balancing hormones, lowering inflammation, preventing/reversing disease and better sleep. Let light and sunshine be your guide (alarm clock) for eating and fasting.<br><br>\u258c<b>Understand and learn with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>Why you need UV light to make melatonin?<br>Why is sunshine essential for your hormonal balance and health?<br>Why should your alarm clock be ideally linked to sunrise?<br>What fasting times support your circadian rhythm, hormones and sleep?<br>Find these and many other answers with Circadian!<br>The learn section provides carefully curated in-depth content, practical suggestions &amp; many surprises.<br>Learn about circadian rhythm, light (sunshine, UV, red/infrared &amp; artificial light), melatonin, sleep, natural cycles &amp; much more.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions are linked to almost every modern disease, from diabetes to cancer. Don&#39;t believe it? Search: &quot;shift work&quot; or &quot;circadian rhythm&quot; plus a disease name.<br><br>\u258c<b>What does Circadian cost?</b> \ud83d\udcb5<br>Circadian offers a 7-day free trial + a limited free version after that. Prices for the full version vary based on the country/region.<br><br>\ud83d\udc9a Set your sunrise &amp; sunset alarm clock, bathe in more natural light, make the nights dark again, build strong natural cycles and experience harmony with your environment. <br>\u26a1  Light up your day and optimise circadian rhythm, biorhythm, natural cycles and health naturally.<br>\ud83c\udf05  <b>Download Circadian now!</b>",

    "descriptionHtml": "Ready for a <b>lifestyle that prioritises health and wellness</b>? <br>Ready for <b>living with more energy and focus</b>? <br>Keen to <b>have better sleep, improve mood and body composition</b>?<br>How about balancing your hormones naturally (via light and intermittent fasting)?<br><br>The answer? Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body. <br>Anchor your life to sunrise and sunset to optimise your circadian rhythm and natural cycles.<br><br>\u258c<b>Circadian rhythm, biorhythm &amp; chronobiology: the science</b>\ud83d\udd2c<br><br>Your body&#39;s circadian rhythm are 24-hour cycles of biological, hormonal, and behavioural patterns. This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones (i.e. melatonin), sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, your circadian rhythm has profound implications for well-being and longevity. <br><br>The 2017 Nobel prize in Medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks, chaos, inflammation, and disease are consequences. <br><br>Circadian is your natural alarm clock. Circadian uses local times (i.e. sunrise and sunset) plus user settings to calculate your circadian rhythm, also known as biorhythm. Optimize light, exercise and food timing to finally live better. Harmonize your life with the natural cycles, and let yourself be surprised! <br><br>\u258c<b>An alarm clock for critical circadian events to live well</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>In line with natural cycles, like light &amp; dark and the seasons, Circadian acts as an alarm clock for your optimal biorhythm. Start syncing your sleep cycle with nature and be active when you are meant to. Set reminders &amp; alarms for:<br>\u25cb daybreak, sunrise, solar noon, sunset and nightfall<br>\u25cb ultraviolet light rise and fall (UV)<br>\u25cb sleep and wake times<br>\u25cb natural eating and fasting <br>\u25cb morning and peak exercise<br>\u25cb peak cognition<br><br>\u258c<b>Adjust your sleep with the seasons</b>\ud83d\udca4 <br>Your biorhythms govern daily functioning, while seasonal rhythms affect longer-term behavioural &amp; metabolic changes. Circadian adjusts your sleep duration dynamically based on the sunshine hours at your location. Let your biorhythm become the alarm clock that keeps you in sync with natural cycles, balances hormones (ie cortisol &amp; melatonin), and leads to better sleep.<br><br>\u258c<b>Include fasting in your daily schedule </b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Eating and fasting are important cues for your biorhythm. Aligning your eating time with circadian rhythms is essential to balancing hormones, lowering inflammation, preventing/reversing disease and better sleep. Let light and sunshine be your guide (alarm clock) for eating and fasting.<br><br>\u258c<b>Understand and learn with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>Why you need UV light to make melatonin?<br>Why is sunshine essential for your hormonal balance and health?<br>Why should your alarm clock be ideally linked to sunrise?<br>What fasting times support your circadian rhythm, hormones and sleep?<br>Find these and many other answers with Circadian!<br>The learn section provides carefully curated in-depth content, practical suggestions &amp; many surprises.<br>Learn about circadian rhythm, light (sunshine, UV, red/infrared &amp; artificial light), melatonin, sleep, natural cycles &amp; much more.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions are linked to almost every modern disease, from diabetes to cancer. Don&#39;t believe it? Search: &quot;shift work&quot; or &quot;circadian rhythm&quot; plus a disease name.<br><br>\u258c<b>What does Circadian cost?</b> \ud83d\udcb5<br>Circadian offers a 7-day free trial + a limited free version after that. Prices for the full version vary based on the country/region.<br><br>\ud83d\udc9a Set your sunrise &amp; sunset alarm clock, bathe in more natural light, make the nights dark again, build strong natural cycles and experience harmony with your environment. <br>\u26a1  Light up your day and optimise circadian rhythm, biorhythm, natural cycles and health naturally.<br>\ud83c\udf05  <b>Download Circadian now!</b>",

    "descriptionHtml": "Ready for a <b>lifestyle that prioritises health and wellness</b>? <br>Ready for <b>living with more energy and focus</b>? <br>Keen to <b>have better sleep, improve mood and body composition</b>?<br>How about balancing your hormones naturally (via light and intermittent fasting)?<br><br>The answer? Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body. <br>Anchor your life to sunrise and sunset to optimise your circadian rhythm and natural cycles.<br><br>\u258c<b>Circadian rhythm, biorhythm &amp; chronobiology: the science</b>\ud83d\udd2c<br><br>Your body&#39;s circadian rhythm are 24-hour cycles of biological, hormonal, and behavioural patterns. This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones (i.e. melatonin), sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, your circadian rhythm has profound implications for well-being and longevity. <br><br>The 2017 Nobel prize in Medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks, chaos, inflammation, and disease are consequences. <br><br>Circadian is your natural alarm clock. Circadian uses local times (i.e. sunrise and sunset) plus user settings to calculate your circadian rhythm, also known as biorhythm. Optimize light, exercise and food timing to finally live better. Harmonize your life with the natural cycles, and let yourself be surprised! <br><br>\u258c<b>An alarm clock for critical circadian events to live well</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>In line with natural cycles, like light &amp; dark and the seasons, Circadian acts as an alarm clock for your optimal biorhythm. Start syncing your sleep cycle with nature and be active when you are meant to. Set reminders &amp; alarms for:<br>\u25cb daybreak, sunrise, solar noon, sunset and nightfall<br>\u25cb ultraviolet light rise and fall (UV)<br>\u25cb sleep and wake times<br>\u25cb natural eating and fasting <br>\u25cb morning and peak exercise<br>\u25cb peak cognition<br><br>\u258c<b>Adjust your sleep with the seasons</b>\ud83d\udca4 <br>Your biorhythms govern daily functioning, while seasonal rhythms affect longer-term behavioural &amp; metabolic changes. Circadian adjusts your sleep duration dynamically based on the sunshine hours at your location. Let your biorhythm become the alarm clock that keeps you in sync with natural cycles, balances hormones (ie cortisol &amp; melatonin), and leads to better sleep.<br><br>\u258c<b>Include fasting in your daily schedule </b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Eating and fasting are important cues for your biorhythm. Aligning your eating time with circadian rhythms is essential to balancing hormones, lowering inflammation, preventing/reversing disease and better sleep. Let light and sunshine be your guide (alarm clock) for eating and fasting.<br><br>\u258c<b>Understand and learn with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>Why you need UV light to make melatonin?<br>Why is sunshine essential for your hormonal balance and health?<br>Why should your alarm clock be ideally linked to sunrise?<br>What fasting times support your circadian rhythm, hormones and sleep?<br>Find these and many other answers with Circadian!<br>The learn section provides carefully curated in-depth content, practical suggestions &amp; many surprises.<br>Learn about circadian rhythm, light (sunshine, UV, red/infrared &amp; artificial light), melatonin, sleep, natural cycles &amp; much more.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions are linked to almost every modern disease, from diabetes to cancer. Don&#39;t believe it? Search: &quot;shift work&quot; or &quot;circadian rhythm&quot; plus a disease name.<br><br>\u258c<b>What does Circadian cost?</b> \ud83d\udcb5<br>Circadian offers a 7-day free trial + a limited free version after that. Prices for the full version vary based on the country/region.<br><br>\ud83d\udc9a Set your sunrise &amp; sunset alarm clock, bathe in more natural light, make the nights dark again, build strong natural cycles and experience harmony with your environment. <br>\u26a1  Light up your day and optimise circadian rhythm, biorhythm, natural cycles and health naturally.<br>\ud83c\udf05  <b>Download Circadian now!</b>",

Do your daily activities at the optimal time for your body. <br>Anchor your life to sunrise and sunset to optimise your circadian rhythm and natural cycles.<br><br>\u258c<b>Circadian rhythm, biorhythm &amp; chronobiology: the science</b>\ud83d\udd2c<br><br>Your body&#39;s circadian rhythm are 24-hour cycles of biological, hormonal, and behavioural patterns. This biorhythm modulates a wide array of physiological processes, including your hormones (i.e. melatonin), sleep, hunger, and metabolism, ultimately regulating body weight, performance, mood and susceptibility to disease. As such, your circadian rhythm has profound implications for well-being and longevity. <br><br>The 2017 Nobel prize in Medicine was given for research on circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks in almost all of your cells govern cellular functioning. When you disrupt your circadian clocks, chaos, inflammation, and disease are consequences. <br><br>Circadian is your natural alarm clock. Circadian uses local times (i.e. sunrise and sunset) plus user settings to calculate your circadian rhythm, also known as biorhythm. Optimize light, exercise and food timing to finally live better. Harmonize your life with the natural cycles, and let yourself be surprised! <br><br>\u258c<b>An alarm clock for critical circadian events to live well</b> \ud83d\udd14<br>In line with natural cycles, like light &amp; dark and the seasons, Circadian acts as an alarm clock for your optimal biorhythm. Start syncing your sleep cycle with nature and be active when you are meant to. Set reminders &amp; alarms for:<br>\u25cb daybreak, sunrise, solar noon, sunset and nightfall<br>\u25cb ultraviolet light rise and fall (UV)<br>\u25cb sleep and wake times<br>\u25cb natural eating and fasting <br>\u25cb morning and peak exercise<br>\u25cb peak cognition<br><br>\u258c<b>Adjust your sleep with the seasons</b>\ud83d\udca4 <br>Your biorhythms govern daily functioning, while seasonal rhythms affect longer-term behavioural &amp; metabolic changes. Circadian adjusts your sleep duration dynamically based on the sunshine hours at your location. Let your biorhythm become the alarm clock that keeps you in sync with natural cycles, balances hormones (ie cortisol &amp; melatonin), and leads to better sleep.<br><br>\u258c<b>Include fasting in your daily schedule </b> \ud83c\udf74 <br>Eating and fasting are important cues for your biorhythm. Aligning your eating time with circadian rhythms is essential to balancing hormones, lowering inflammation, preventing/reversing disease and better sleep. Let light and sunshine be your guide (alarm clock) for eating and fasting.<br><br>\u258c<b>Understand and learn with Circadian</b> \ud83d\udca1<br>Why you need UV light to make melatonin?<br>Why is sunshine essential for your hormonal balance and health?<br>Why should your alarm clock be ideally linked to sunrise?<br>What fasting times support your circadian rhythm, hormones and sleep?<br>Find these and many other answers with Circadian!<br>The learn section provides carefully curated in-depth content, practical suggestions &amp; many surprises.<br>Learn about circadian rhythm, light (sunshine, UV, red/infrared &amp; artificial light), melatonin, sleep, natural cycles &amp; much more.<br><br>\u258c<b>Still doubtful?</b> \u261d\ufe0f<br>Consider that circadian disruptions are linked to almost every modern disease, from diabetes to cancer.

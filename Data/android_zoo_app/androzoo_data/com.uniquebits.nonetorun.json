    "descriptionHtml": "Are you looking to become a runner for the first time? Coming back to running after a hiatus? In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk. No time-consuming and confusing programming of intervals is required!<br>\u2022 Play music or podcasts using the app of your choice! The app will temporarily lower the volume during alerts.<br>\u2022 Track and store all of your workouts.<br>\u2022 Runs in the background with the screen locked to conserve battery life.<br>\u2022 Show off your stats on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using share cards.<br>\u2022 NO annoying ads!<br>\u2022 Open runs (when you just feel like working out without using a specific plan).<br><br>STRENGTH &amp; MOBILITY ROUTINES<br><br>\u2022 Running is stressful on the body. Especially when you\u2019re just getting started. Beginner runners generally do not have the lower body strength needed to cope with the demands of running.<br>\u2022 N2R includes carefully designed strength and mobility routines (with video demos) to help you get strong and reduce the chances of getting injured!<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING &amp; TERMS<br><br>None to Run is free to download and use.

    "descriptionHtml": "Are you looking to become a runner for the first time? Coming back to running after a hiatus? In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk. No time-consuming and confusing programming of intervals is required!<br>\u2022 Once you&#39;ve completed the None to Run plan, use the Run to Race 5K plan to start working on your speed and get you &quot;race ready&quot;.<br>\u2022 There&#39;s also a Run to Race 10K plan.<br>\u2022 Play music or podcasts using the app of your choice! The app will temporarily lower the volume during alerts.<br>\u2022 Track and store all of your workouts.<br>\u2022 Runs in the background with the screen locked to conserve battery life.<br>\u2022 Show off your stats on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using share cards.<br>\u2022 NO annoying ads!<br>\u2022 Open runs (when you just feel like working out without using a specific plan).<br><br>STRENGTH &amp; MOBILITY ROUTINES<br><br>\u2022 Running is stressful on the body. Especially when you\u2019re just getting started. Beginner runners generally do not have the lower body strength needed to cope with the demands of running.<br>\u2022 N2R includes carefully designed strength and mobility routines (with video demos) to help you get strong and reduce the chances of getting injured!<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING &amp; TERMS<br><br>None to Run is free to download and use. The free version provides access to the first week of all training programs. To gain unlimited access to the entire training program and all the app features, you may choose between a monthly or yearly auto-renewing subscription option.<br><br>Payment will be charged to your credit card through your Google Play account at the confirmation of the purchase. Subscription renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the subscription period.<br><br>Subscriptions can be managed in the Google Play app.<br> <br>Privacy Policy: https://www.nonetorun.com/privacy-policy<br>Terms of Service: https://www.nonetorun.com/terms-and-conditions-app<br><br>Email support@nonetorun.com with any questions!",

NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured.

    "descriptionHtml": "Are you looking to become a runner for the first time? Coming back to running after a hiatus? In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk. No time-consuming and confusing programming of intervals is required!<br>\u2022 Once you&#39;ve completed the None to Run plan, use the Run to Race 5K plan to start working on your speed and get you &quot;race ready&quot;.<br>\u2022 There&#39;s also a Run to Race 10K plan.<br>\u2022 Play music or podcasts using the app of your choice! The app will temporarily lower the volume during alerts.<br>\u2022 Track and store all of your workouts.<br>\u2022 Runs in the background with the screen locked to conserve battery life.<br>\u2022 Show off your stats on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using share cards.<br>\u2022 NO annoying ads!<br>\u2022 Open runs (when you just feel like working out without using a specific plan).<br><br>STRENGTH &amp; MOBILITY ROUTINES<br><br>\u2022 Running is stressful on the body. Especially when you\u2019re just getting started. Beginner runners generally do not have the lower body strength needed to cope with the demands of running.<br>\u2022 N2R includes carefully designed strength and mobility routines (with video demos) to help you get strong and reduce the chances of getting injured!<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING &amp; TERMS<br><br>None to Run is free to download and use. The free version provides access to the first week of all training programs. To gain unlimited access to the entire training program and all the app features, you may choose between a monthly or yearly auto-renewing subscription option.<br><br>Payment will be charged to your credit card through your Google Play account at the confirmation of the purchase.

In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk.

In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk. No time-consuming and confusing programming of intervals is required!<br>\u2022 Once you&#39;ve completed the None to Run plan, use the Run to Race 5K plan to start working on your speed and get you &quot;race ready&quot;.<br>\u2022 There&#39;s also a Run to Race 10K plan.<br>\u2022 Play music or podcasts using the app of your choice! The app will temporarily lower the volume during alerts.<br>\u2022 Track and store all of your workouts.<br>\u2022 Runs in the background with the screen locked to conserve battery life.<br>\u2022 Show off your stats on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using share cards.<br>\u2022 NO annoying ads!<br>\u2022 Open runs (when you just feel like working out without using a specific plan).<br><br>STRENGTH &amp; MOBILITY ROUTINES<br><br>\u2022 Running is stressful on the body. Especially when you\u2019re just getting started. Beginner runners generally do not have the lower body strength needed to cope with the demands of running.<br>\u2022 N2R includes carefully designed strength and mobility routines (with video demos) to help you get strong and reduce the chances of getting injured!<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING &amp; TERMS<br><br>None to Run is free to download and use.

    "descriptionHtml": "Are you looking to become a runner for the first time? Coming back to running after a hiatus? In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk. No time-consuming and confusing programming of intervals is required!<br>\u2022 Once you&#39;ve completed the None to Run plan, use the Run to Race 5K plan to start working on your speed and get you &quot;race ready&quot;.<br>\u2022 There&#39;s also a Run to Race 10K plan.<br>\u2022 Play music or podcasts using the app of your choice! The app will temporarily lower the volume during alerts.<br>\u2022 Track and store all of your workouts.<br>\u2022 Runs in the background with the screen locked to conserve battery life.<br>\u2022 Show off your stats on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using share cards.<br>\u2022 NO annoying ads!<br>\u2022 Open runs (when you just feel like working out without using a specific plan).<br><br>STRENGTH &amp; MOBILITY ROUTINES<br><br>\u2022 Running is stressful on the body. Especially when you\u2019re just getting started. Beginner runners generally do not have the lower body strength needed to cope with the demands of running.<br>\u2022 N2R includes carefully designed strength and mobility routines (with video demos) to help you get strong and reduce the chances of getting injured!<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING &amp; TERMS<br><br>None to Run is free to download and use. The free version provides access to the first week of all training programs. To gain unlimited access to the entire training program and all the app features, you may choose between a monthly or yearly auto-renewing subscription option.<br><br>Payment will be charged to your credit card through your Google Play account at the confirmation of the purchase. Subscription renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the subscription period.<br><br>Subscriptions can be managed in the Google Play app.<br> <br>Privacy Policy: https://www.nonetorun.com/privacy-policy<br>Terms of Service: https://www.nonetorun.com/terms-and-conditions-app<br><br>Email support@nonetorun.com with any questions!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Are you looking to become a runner for the first time? Coming back to running after a hiatus? In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk. No time-consuming and confusing programming of intervals is required!<br>\u2022 Once you&#39;ve completed the None to Run plan, use the Run to Race 5K plan to start working on your speed and get you &quot;race ready&quot;.<br>\u2022 There&#39;s also a Run to Race 10K plan.<br>\u2022 Play music or podcasts using the app of your choice! The app will temporarily lower the volume during alerts.<br>\u2022 Track and store all of your workouts.<br>\u2022 Runs in the background with the screen locked to conserve battery life.<br>\u2022 Show off your stats on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using share cards.<br>\u2022 NO annoying ads!<br>\u2022 Open runs (when you just feel like working out without using a specific plan).<br><br>STRENGTH &amp; MOBILITY ROUTINES<br><br>\u2022 Running is stressful on the body. Especially when you\u2019re just getting started. Beginner runners generally do not have the lower body strength needed to cope with the demands of running.<br>\u2022 N2R includes carefully designed strength and mobility routines (with video demos) to help you get strong and reduce the chances of getting injured!<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING &amp; TERMS<br><br>None to Run is free to download and use. The free version provides access to the first week of all training programs. To gain unlimited access to the entire training program and all the app features, you may choose between a monthly or yearly auto-renewing subscription option.<br><br>Payment will be charged to your credit card through your Google Play account at the confirmation of the purchase. Subscription renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the subscription period.<br><br>Subscriptions can be managed in the Google Play app.<br> <br>Privacy Policy: https://www.nonetorun.com/privacy-policy<br>Terms of Service: https://www.nonetorun.com/terms-and-conditions-app<br><br>Email support@nonetorun.com with any questions!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Are you looking to become a runner for the first time? Coming back to running after a hiatus? In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk. No time-consuming and confusing programming of intervals is required!<br>\u2022 Once you&#39;ve completed the None to Run plan, use the Run to Race 5K plan to start working on your speed and get you &quot;race ready&quot;.<br>\u2022 There&#39;s also a Run to Race 10K plan.<br>\u2022 Play music or podcasts using the app of your choice! The app will temporarily lower the volume during alerts.<br>\u2022 Track and store all of your workouts.<br>\u2022 Runs in the background with the screen locked to conserve battery life.<br>\u2022 Show off your stats on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using share cards.<br>\u2022 NO annoying ads!<br>\u2022 Open runs (when you just feel like working out without using a specific plan).<br><br>STRENGTH &amp; MOBILITY ROUTINES<br><br>\u2022 Running is stressful on the body. Especially when you\u2019re just getting started. Beginner runners generally do not have the lower body strength needed to cope with the demands of running.<br>\u2022 N2R includes carefully designed strength and mobility routines (with video demos) to help you get strong and reduce the chances of getting injured!<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING &amp; TERMS<br><br>None to Run is free to download and use. The free version provides access to the first week of all training programs. To gain unlimited access to the entire training program and all the app features, you may choose between a monthly or yearly auto-renewing subscription option.<br><br>Payment will be charged to your credit card through your Google Play account at the confirmation of the purchase. Subscription renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the subscription period.<br><br>Subscriptions can be managed in the Google Play app.<br> <br>Privacy Policy: https://www.nonetorun.com/privacy-policy<br>Terms of Service: https://www.nonetorun.com/terms-and-conditions-app<br><br>Email support@nonetorun.com with any questions!",

NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured.

    "descriptionHtml": "Are you looking to become a runner for the first time? Coming back to running after a hiatus? In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk. No time-consuming and confusing programming of intervals is required!<br>\u2022 Once you&#39;ve completed the None to Run plan, use the Run to Race 5K plan to start working on your speed and get you &quot;race ready&quot;.<br>\u2022 There&#39;s also a Run to Race 10K plan.<br>\u2022 Play music or podcasts using the app of your choice! The app will temporarily lower the volume during alerts.<br>\u2022 Track and store all of your workouts.<br>\u2022 Runs in the background with the screen locked to conserve battery life.<br>\u2022 Show off your stats on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using share cards.<br>\u2022 NO annoying ads!<br>\u2022 Open runs (when you just feel like working out without using a specific plan).<br><br>STRENGTH &amp; MOBILITY ROUTINES<br><br>\u2022 Running is stressful on the body. Especially when you\u2019re just getting started. Beginner runners generally do not have the lower body strength needed to cope with the demands of running.<br>\u2022 N2R includes carefully designed strength and mobility routines (with video demos) to help you get strong and reduce the chances of getting injured!<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING &amp; TERMS<br><br>None to Run is free to download and use. The free version provides access to the first week of all training programs. To gain unlimited access to the entire training program and all the app features, you may choose between a monthly or yearly auto-renewing subscription option.<br><br>Payment will be charged to your credit card through your Google Play account at the confirmation of the purchase.

    "descriptionHtml": "Are you looking to become a runner for the first time? Coming back to running after a hiatus? In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk. No time-consuming and confusing programming of intervals is required!<br>\u2022 Once you&#39;ve completed the None to Run plan, use the Run to Race 5K plan to start working on your speed and get you &quot;race ready&quot;.<br>\u2022 There&#39;s also a Run to Race 10K plan.<br>\u2022 Play music or podcasts using the app of your choice! The app will temporarily lower the volume during alerts.<br>\u2022 Track and store all of your workouts.<br>\u2022 Runs in the background with the screen locked to conserve battery life.<br>\u2022 Show off your stats on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using share cards.<br>\u2022 NO annoying ads!<br>\u2022 Open runs (when you just feel like working out without using a specific plan).<br><br>STRENGTH &amp; MOBILITY ROUTINES<br><br>\u2022 Running is stressful on the body. Especially when you\u2019re just getting started. Beginner runners generally do not have the lower body strength needed to cope with the demands of running.<br>\u2022 N2R includes carefully designed strength and mobility routines (with video demos) to help you get strong and reduce the chances of getting injured!<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING &amp; TERMS<br><br>None to Run is free to download and use. The free version provides access to the first week of all training programs. To gain unlimited access to the entire training program and all the app features, you may choose between a monthly or yearly auto-renewing subscription option.<br><br>Payment will be charged to your credit card through your Google Play account at the confirmation of the purchase. Subscription renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the subscription period.<br><br>Subscriptions can be managed in the Google Play app.<br> <br>Privacy Policy: https://www.nonetorun.com/privacy-policy<br>Terms of Service: https://www.nonetorun.com/terms-and-conditions-app<br><br>Email support@nonetorun.com with any questions!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Are you looking to become a runner for the first time? Coming back to running after a hiatus? In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk. No time-consuming and confusing programming of intervals is required!<br>\u2022 Once you&#39;ve completed the None to Run plan, use the Run to Race 5K plan to start working on your speed and get you &quot;race ready&quot;.<br>\u2022 There&#39;s also a Run to Race 10K plan.<br>\u2022 Play music or podcasts using the app of your choice! The app will temporarily lower the volume during alerts.<br>\u2022 Track and store all of your workouts.<br>\u2022 Runs in the background with the screen locked to conserve battery life.<br>\u2022 Show off your stats on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using share cards.<br>\u2022 NO annoying ads!<br>\u2022 Open runs (when you just feel like working out without using a specific plan).<br><br>STRENGTH &amp; MOBILITY ROUTINES<br><br>\u2022 Running is stressful on the body. Especially when you\u2019re just getting started. Beginner runners generally do not have the lower body strength needed to cope with the demands of running.<br>\u2022 N2R includes carefully designed strength and mobility routines (with video demos) to help you get strong and reduce the chances of getting injured!<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING &amp; TERMS<br><br>None to Run is free to download and use. The free version provides access to the first week of all training programs. To gain unlimited access to the entire training program and all the app features, you may choose between a monthly or yearly auto-renewing subscription option.<br><br>Payment will be charged to your credit card through your Google Play account at the confirmation of the purchase. Subscription renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the subscription period.<br><br>Subscriptions can be managed in the Google Play app.<br> <br>Privacy Policy: https://www.nonetorun.com/privacy-policy<br>Terms of Service: https://www.nonetorun.com/terms-and-conditions-app<br><br>Email support@nonetorun.com with any questions!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Are you looking to become a runner for the first time? Coming back to running after a hiatus? In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk. No time-consuming and confusing programming of intervals is required!<br>\u2022 Once you&#39;ve completed the None to Run plan, use the Run to Race 5K plan to start working on your speed and get you &quot;race ready&quot;.<br>\u2022 There&#39;s also a Run to Race 10K plan.<br>\u2022 Play music or podcasts using the app of your choice! The app will temporarily lower the volume during alerts.<br>\u2022 Track and store all of your workouts.<br>\u2022 Runs in the background with the screen locked to conserve battery life.<br>\u2022 Show off your stats on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using share cards.<br>\u2022 NO annoying ads!<br>\u2022 Open runs (when you just feel like working out without using a specific plan).<br><br>STRENGTH &amp; MOBILITY ROUTINES<br><br>\u2022 Running is stressful on the body. Especially when you\u2019re just getting started. Beginner runners generally do not have the lower body strength needed to cope with the demands of running.<br>\u2022 N2R includes carefully designed strength and mobility routines (with video demos) to help you get strong and reduce the chances of getting injured!<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING &amp; TERMS<br><br>None to Run is free to download and use. The free version provides access to the first week of all training programs. To gain unlimited access to the entire training program and all the app features, you may choose between a monthly or yearly auto-renewing subscription option.<br><br>Payment will be charged to your credit card through your Google Play account at the confirmation of the purchase. Subscription renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the subscription period.<br><br>Subscriptions can be managed in the Google Play app.<br> <br>Privacy Policy: https://www.nonetorun.com/privacy-policy<br>Terms of Service: https://www.nonetorun.com/terms-and-conditions-app<br><br>Email support@nonetorun.com with any questions!",

In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk.

    "descriptionHtml": "Are you looking to become a runner for the first time? Coming back to running after a hiatus? In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk. No time-consuming and confusing programming of intervals is required!<br>\u2022 Once you&#39;ve completed the None to Run plan, use the Run to Race 5K plan to start working on your speed and get you &quot;race ready&quot;.<br>\u2022 There&#39;s also a Run to Race 10K plan.<br>\u2022 Play music or podcasts using the app of your choice! The app will temporarily lower the volume during alerts.<br>\u2022 Track and store all of your workouts.<br>\u2022 Runs in the background with the screen locked to conserve battery life.<br>\u2022 Show off your stats on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using share cards.<br>\u2022 NO annoying ads!<br>\u2022 Open runs (when you just feel like working out without using a specific plan).<br><br>STRENGTH &amp; MOBILITY ROUTINES<br><br>\u2022 Running is stressful on the body. Especially when you\u2019re just getting started. Beginner runners generally do not have the lower body strength needed to cope with the demands of running.<br>\u2022 N2R includes carefully designed strength and mobility routines (with video demos) to help you get strong and reduce the chances of getting injured!<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING &amp; TERMS<br><br>None to Run is free to download and use. The free version provides access to the first week of all training programs. To gain unlimited access to the entire training program and all the app features, you may choose between a monthly or yearly auto-renewing subscription option.<br><br>Payment will be charged to your credit card through your Google Play account at the confirmation of the purchase. Subscription renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the subscription period.<br><br>Subscriptions can be managed in the Google Play app.<br> <br>Privacy Policy: https://www.nonetorun.com/privacy-policy<br>Terms of Service: https://www.nonetorun.com/terms-and-conditions-app<br><br>Email support@nonetorun.com with any questions!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Are you looking to become a runner for the first time? Coming back to running after a hiatus? In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk. No time-consuming and confusing programming of intervals is required!<br>\u2022 Once you&#39;ve completed the None to Run plan, use the Run to Race 5K plan to start working on your speed and get you &quot;race ready&quot;.<br>\u2022 There&#39;s also a Run to Race 10K plan.<br>\u2022 Play music or podcasts using the app of your choice! The app will temporarily lower the volume during alerts.<br>\u2022 Track and store all of your workouts.<br>\u2022 Runs in the background with the screen locked to conserve battery life.<br>\u2022 Show off your stats on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using share cards.<br>\u2022 NO annoying ads!<br>\u2022 Open runs (when you just feel like working out without using a specific plan).<br><br>STRENGTH &amp; MOBILITY ROUTINES<br><br>\u2022 Running is stressful on the body. Especially when you\u2019re just getting started.

    "descriptionHtml": "Are you looking to become a runner for the first time? Coming back to running after a hiatus? In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk. No time-consuming and confusing programming of intervals is required!<br>\u2022 Once you&#39;ve completed the None to Run plan, use the Run to Race 5K plan to start working on your speed and get you &quot;race ready&quot;.<br>\u2022 There&#39;s also a Run to Race 10K plan.<br>\u2022 Play music or podcasts using the app of your choice! The app will temporarily lower the volume during alerts.<br>\u2022 Track and store all of your workouts.<br>\u2022 Runs in the background with the screen locked to conserve battery life.<br>\u2022 Show off your stats on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using share cards.<br>\u2022 NO annoying ads!<br>\u2022 Open runs (when you just feel like working out without using a specific plan).<br><br>STRENGTH &amp; MOBILITY ROUTINES<br><br>\u2022 Running is stressful on the body. Especially when you\u2019re just getting started. Beginner runners generally do not have the lower body strength needed to cope with the demands of running.<br>\u2022 N2R includes carefully designed strength and mobility routines (with video demos) to help you get strong and reduce the chances of getting injured!<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING &amp; TERMS<br><br>None to Run is free to download and use. The free version provides access to the first week of all training programs. To gain unlimited access to the entire training program and all the app features, you may choose between a monthly or yearly auto-renewing subscription option.<br><br>Payment will be charged to your credit card through your Google Play account at the confirmation of the purchase. Subscription renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the subscription period.<br><br>Subscriptions can be managed in the Google Play app.<br> <br>Privacy Policy: https://www.nonetorun.com/privacy-policy<br>Terms of Service: https://www.nonetorun.com/terms-and-conditions-app<br><br>Email support@nonetorun.com with any questions!",

NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured.

    "descriptionHtml": "Are you looking to become a runner for the first time? Coming back to running after a hiatus? In 3 workouts of 30 minutes or less per week, N2R will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25 minutes straight.<br><br>None to Run is a gradual running plan designed for people like you.<br><br>Here\u2019s how the N2R differs from most beginner plans:<br><br>\u2022 Focuses on running time. NOT distance or pace. This makes running more enjoyable.<br>\u2022 Unlike most beginner plans, N2R Includes simple strength and mobility workouts. No equipment is required.<br>\u2022 Progresses conservatively to enhance enjoyment and decrease the chances of getting injured.<br><br>If you can&#39;t currently run for more than 5-minutes straight without stopping to catch your breath, you&#39;re in the right place.<br><br>The None to Run 12-Week Plan will take you from ground zero to running comfortably for 25-minutes straight.<br><br>Thousands of people have already used the None to Run plan to become the runner they\u2019ve always wanted to be finally. <br><br>It\u2019s your turn.<br><br>N2R FEEDBACK:<br><br>&quot;Couch to 5k, moved too fast for me, and I found this program when seeking something different.&quot;<br><br>\u201cA gentle, safe way to become a runner.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA beginning running program, designed to build consistency and keep you from being injured. By the end of 12-weeks, you&#39;re running 25-minutes straight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPerfect program to ease you into training.\u201d<br><br>&quot;I tried the Couch to 5K program twice and failed. I\u2019m now on the last week of the None to Run program, and I actually look forward to running now.&quot;<br><br>The N2R app provides the best experience to follow and complete the 12-Week None to Run plan successfully.<br><br>TOP FEATURES<br><br>\u2022 The entire 12-week None to Run plan, with spoken audio cues telling you when to run and when to walk. No time-consuming and confusing programming of intervals is required!<br>\u2022 Once you&#39;ve completed the None to Run plan, use the Run to Race 5K plan to start working on your speed and get you &quot;race ready&quot;.<br>\u2022 There&#39;s also a Run to Race 10K plan.<br>\u2022 Play music or podcasts using the app of your choice! The app will temporarily lower the volume during alerts.<br>\u2022 Track and store all of your workouts.<br>\u2022 Runs in the background with the screen locked to conserve battery life.<br>\u2022 Show off your stats on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using share cards.<br>\u2022 NO annoying ads!<br>\u2022 Open runs (when you just feel like working out without using a specific plan).<br><br>STRENGTH &amp; MOBILITY ROUTINES<br><br>\u2022 Running is stressful on the body. Especially when you\u2019re just getting started. Beginner runners generally do not have the lower body strength needed to cope with the demands of running.<br>\u2022 N2R includes carefully designed strength and mobility routines (with video demos) to help you get strong and reduce the chances of getting injured!<br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING &amp; TERMS<br><br>None to Run is free to download and use. The free version provides access to the first week of all training programs. To gain unlimited access to the entire training program and all the app features, you may choose between a monthly or yearly auto-renewing subscription option.<br><br>Payment will be charged to your credit card through your Google Play account at the confirmation of the purchase. Subscription renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the subscription period.<br><br>Subscriptions can be managed in the Google Play app.<br> <br>Privacy Policy: https://www.nonetorun.com/privacy-policy<br>Terms of Service: https://www.nonetorun.com/terms-and-conditions-app<br><br>Email support@nonetorun.com with any questions!",

    "descriptionHtml": "RapidParty will take the stress out of party planning.  While optimized for house parties, Rapid Party can be used for a wide variety of events.  RapidParty has added or improved features that are lacking in other event planning platforms.  There is a lean private social networking platform built around optimized for event management.  Unlike other social networking platforms, RapidParty has no need to make money from our user&#39;s data so your data is safe with us! <br><br>Item Registry <br><br>The Item Registry offers the host a means to request certain items be brought to the party by their guests.  It also allows guests to write down what they intend to bring if was not explicitly requested.  No more 6 bags of chips and no dip!  Request things like tables, chairs, ice, specific food, etc. <br><br>Crowdfunding <br><br>Practical and efficient.  In an effort to encourage Users to host more events, RapidParty is introducing Crowdfunding to social events.  Instead of wasteful trips to grocery or convenienence store guests can simply pledge/contribute cash.  By pooling the contributions together the combined money can be used efficiently to better fulfill the event.  The host may use the money to purchase services like Cleaning or Catering thus reducing their stress and the likelyhood they will host again. <br><br>Invites and Groups <br><br>Inviting is very easy and reliable.  The host is able to invite not only RapidParty members but also others by means of Email and Phone Number.  The host can create contact lists and private groups and later invite the members to the event.  Overlapping members will be taken care of.  Organize your friends into groups and invite a couple of groups to your event and you are done! <br><br>Social Networking <br><br>Connections, Groups, Contact Lists, Posting. A productive social networking platform is built around the event planning. Build your network by connecting to those that may attend your events or you may attend theirs.  Public and private groups can be created to gather people aimed for particular events.   Members can productively communicate within the group and events to facilitate the events.  Organize your contacts in private contact lists for later use.",

In an effort to encourage Users to host more events, RapidParty is introducing Crowdfunding to social events.  Instead of wasteful trips to grocery or convenienence store guests can simply pledge/contribute cash.  By pooling the contributions together the combined money can be used efficiently to better fulfill the event.  The host may use the money to purchase services like Cleaning or Catering thus reducing their stress and the likelyhood they will host again. <br><br>Invites and Groups <br><br>Inviting is very easy and reliable.  The host is able to invite not only RapidParty members but also others by means of Email and Phone Number.  The host can create contact lists and private groups and later invite the members to the event.  Overlapping members will be taken care of.  Organize your friends into groups and invite a couple of groups to your event and you are done! <br><br>Social Networking <br><br>Connections, Groups, Contact Lists, Posting. A productive social networking platform is built around the event planning. Build your network by connecting to those that may attend your events or you may attend theirs.  Public and private groups can be created to gather people aimed for particular events.   Members can productively communicate within the group and events to facilitate the events.  Organize your contacts in private contact lists for later use.",

    "descriptionHtml": "RapidParty will take the stress out of party planning.  While optimized for house parties, Rapid Party can be used for a wide variety of events.  RapidParty has added or improved features that are lacking in other event planning platforms.  There is a lean private social networking platform built around optimized for event management.  Unlike other social networking platforms, RapidParty has no need to make money from our user&#39;s data so your data is safe with us! <br><br>Item Registry <br><br>The Item Registry offers the host a means to request certain items be brought to the party by their guests.  It also allows guests to write down what they intend to bring if was not explicitly requested.  No more 6 bags of chips and no dip!  Request things like tables, chairs, ice, specific food, etc. <br><br>Crowdfunding <br><br>Practical and efficient.  In an effort to encourage Users to host more events, RapidParty is introducing Crowdfunding to social events.  Instead of wasteful trips to grocery or convenienence store guests can simply pledge/contribute cash.  By pooling the contributions together the combined money can be used efficiently to better fulfill the event.  The host may use the money to purchase services like Cleaning or Catering thus reducing their stress and the likelyhood they will host again. <br><br>Invites and Groups <br><br>Inviting is very easy and reliable.  The host is able to invite not only RapidParty members but also others by means of Email and Phone Number.  The host can create contact lists and private groups and later invite the members to the event.  Overlapping members will be taken care of.  Organize your friends into groups and invite a couple of groups to your event and you are done! <br><br>Social Networking <br><br>Connections, Groups, Contact Lists, Posting. A productive social networking platform is built around the event planning. Build your network by connecting to those that may attend your events or you may attend theirs.  Public and private groups can be created to gather people aimed for particular events.   Members can productively communicate within the group and events to facilitate the events.  Organize your contacts in private contact lists for later use.",

    "descriptionHtml": "RapidParty will take the stress out of party planning.  While optimized for house parties, Rapid Party can be used for a wide variety of events.  RapidParty has added or improved features that are lacking in other event planning platforms.  There is a lean private social networking platform built around optimized for event management.  Unlike other social networking platforms, RapidParty has no need to make money from our user&#39;s data so your data is safe with us! <br><br>Item Registry <br><br>The Item Registry offers the host a means to request certain items be brought to the party by their guests.  It also allows guests to write down what they intend to bring if was not explicitly requested.  No more 6 bags of chips and no dip!  Request things like tables, chairs, ice, specific food, etc. <br><br>Crowdfunding <br><br>Practical and efficient.  In an effort to encourage Users to host more events, RapidParty is introducing Crowdfunding to social events.  Instead of wasteful trips to grocery or convenienence store guests can simply pledge/contribute cash.  By pooling the contributions together the combined money can be used efficiently to better fulfill the event.  The host may use the money to purchase services like Cleaning or Catering thus reducing their stress and the likelyhood they will host again. <br><br>Invites and Groups <br><br>Inviting is very easy and reliable.  The host is able to invite not only RapidParty members but also others by means of Email and Phone Number.  The host can create contact lists and private groups and later invite the members to the event.  Overlapping members will be taken care of.  Organize your friends into groups and invite a couple of groups to your event and you are done! <br><br>Social Networking <br><br>Connections, Groups, Contact Lists, Posting. A productive social networking platform is built around the event planning. Build your network by connecting to those that may attend your events or you may attend theirs.  Public and private groups can be created to gather people aimed for particular events.   Members can productively communicate within the group and events to facilitate the events.  Organize your contacts in private contact lists for later use.",

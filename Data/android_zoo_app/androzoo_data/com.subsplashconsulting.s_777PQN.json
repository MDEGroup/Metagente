    "descriptionHtml": "Abundant Life Church of Erie is an assembly of kingdom warriors who have a love for the Lord and are called to a place of intimacy in the presence of our Father. We seek to know the Father more and walk in the obedience of His Word.<br><br>We are apostolic in that we endeavor to break the fallow ground around us and advance the Kingdom of God with demonstration and power. We are prophetic in that we have presented ourselves to the Lord as vessels for His glory. In the Word of God, the word Prophet is used to describe one who is a seer. They see and hear the Lord God and then respond to the people accordingly. The Prophet is sensitive to the voice of God; he operates with the mind of Christ and not his own. He moves as if he were the hands, eyes, feet, ears of Jesus, and as if he is the very mouthpiece of God.<br><br>As we learn to love the Father, we learn how to love one another in a greater way. Our preparation begins with building character qualities, first and foremost in the depths of our own hearts so that in the time to come, we will be able to manifest the anointing (Glory of God) with wisdom and in greater measure. Our challenge is to add to our daily walk habits such as praying, walking and living in the Spirit.<br>-------------------------------------<br>Apostles Kevin and Denise Nelson are the founders and senior pastors of Abundant Life Church of Erie. They are ordained through the Christian International Network of Churches and are under the covering of Dr. Bill Hamon, Bishop of Christian International Ministries Network. Recognized by their strong passion for equipping the Saints for the work of the ministry, they teach cutting-edge truth for transforming mindsets and releasing life-changing impartations. Their desire is to empower the saints to arise to their greatest potential in the Kingdom.",

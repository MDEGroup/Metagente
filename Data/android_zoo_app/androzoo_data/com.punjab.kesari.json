The Magazine Section depending upon the day of the week gives information on all aspects of life i.e. education, religion, sports, health, entertainment, films, hollywood, bollywood etc. This has resulted in its wider acceptability amongst all classes and masses.\u00a0\u00a0 It is the first language newspaper to have started its magazine in colour and also first one to have started CTP (Computer to Plate) system enabling direct exposing of printing plates from computers.\u00a0 The credit for State of the Art, Technological development and installing best available systems, entirely is attributable to its Director Sh. Aditya Chopra.<br><br>The great freedom fighter and the nationalist Late Lala Jagat Narain, founder of the newspaper, always took a bold editorial stand against the terrorists and separatist elements in Punjab and the price paid by him for this was his assassination by terrorists on September 9, 1981. After the death of Lala Jagat Narain, his elder son Shri Ramesh Chander,\u00a0 took over the reins as the Chief Executive of the Company and the Chief Editor of the Publications. Late Shri Ramesh Chander carried on the crusade against the terrorists and separatist forces with a bold editorial policy, which the newspaper is credited with till date. On 12th May 1984, Late Shri Ramesh Chander also fell to the bullets of the terrorists in Punjab.<br><br>Sh. Ashwini Kumar, succeeding his grandfather and father, as Head of the Group of Newspapers has been carrying on this ancestral legacy with added vigour, unrelenting and unbending in the face of gravest threats issued to him by militant outfits operating in Punjab and J &amp; K etc., including receipt by him of \u201cdeath warrant\u201d issued by militants.<br><br>Punjab Kesari group of newspapers by publishing editorials of Sh. Ashwini Kumar on the front page has given a lead and new direction to the newspaper industry and probably are the first to publish editorial on the front page.<br><br>Sh. Ashwini Kumar has not been deterred at all and is continuing relentless crusade against terrorism with full verboseness, which is reflected in his editorials published in the newspapers.\u00a0 His editorials reflect a bold editorial stand against the terrorists and separatists element.<br><br>The editorials based on facts give analysis of all what has happened in the past, developments at present and give a farsighted vision for the future.<br><br>His writings can safely be attributed to his wisdom and knowledge which is deep rooted.<br><br>Sh. Kumar\u2019s editorials are appreciated for their free, frank and fearless clarity of views and expression.\u00a0 Not only this, the editorials published have in many cases given a direction to the THINK TANK of India\u2019s policy makers, bureaucrats and politicians.<br><br>The study and analysis of National scenario in its wider perspective, Terrorism, Indo-Pak Relations, Pakistan &amp; India\u2019s Policies, their behaviour and attitude have been the issues of great concern for him.\u00a0 His comments/ observations and insight of the role of America and Britain are eye opener and should help the power that be for better understanding.\u00a0\u00a0 The readers at large get benefitted and educated helping in the development and growth.",

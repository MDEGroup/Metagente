    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app! Your feedback is very important to us. GiftYa | The thought that counts<br><br>DOWNLOAD GiftYa today and become the most thoughtful egifter the world has ever seen!",

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app! Your feedback is very important to us. GiftYa | The thought that counts<br><br>DOWNLOAD GiftYa today and become the most thoughtful egifter the world has ever seen!",

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app! Your feedback is very important to us. GiftYa | The thought that counts<br><br>DOWNLOAD GiftYa today and become the most thoughtful egifter the world has ever seen!",

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app! Your feedback is very important to us. GiftYa | The thought that counts<br><br>DOWNLOAD GiftYa today and become the most thoughtful egifter the world has ever seen!",

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app! Your feedback is very important to us. GiftYa | The thought that counts<br><br>DOWNLOAD GiftYa today and become the most thoughtful egifter the world has ever seen!",

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app! Your feedback is very important to us. GiftYa | The thought that counts<br><br>DOWNLOAD GiftYa today and become the most thoughtful egifter the world has ever seen!",

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app! Your feedback is very important to us. GiftYa | The thought that counts<br><br>DOWNLOAD GiftYa today and become the most thoughtful egifter the world has ever seen!",

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app! Your feedback is very important to us. GiftYa | The thought that counts<br><br>DOWNLOAD GiftYa today and become the most thoughtful egifter the world has ever seen!",

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app! Your feedback is very important to us. GiftYa | The thought that counts<br><br>DOWNLOAD GiftYa today and become the most thoughtful egifter the world has ever seen!",

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app! Your feedback is very important to us. GiftYa | The thought that counts<br><br>DOWNLOAD GiftYa today and become the most thoughtful egifter the world has ever seen!",

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app! Your feedback is very important to us. GiftYa | The thought that counts<br><br>DOWNLOAD GiftYa today and become the most thoughtful egifter the world has ever seen!",

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.

Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.

Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.

Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.

Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.

Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app!

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app!

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app! Your feedback is very important to us. GiftYa | The thought that counts<br><br>DOWNLOAD GiftYa today and become the most thoughtful egifter the world has ever seen!",

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app! Your feedback is very important to us. GiftYa | The thought that counts<br><br>DOWNLOAD GiftYa today and become the most thoughtful egifter the world has ever seen!",

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.

Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.

Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.

Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.

Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app! Your feedback is very important to us. GiftYa | The thought that counts<br><br>DOWNLOAD GiftYa today and become the most thoughtful egifter the world has ever seen!",

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.

Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.

Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.

    "descriptionHtml": "The thought that counts!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS <br><br>From the makers of Giftcards.com, gift sharing has been reinvented to be easier, more personalized, and more thoughtful than ever before!  Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.  When you send someone a GiftYa, you can make it a personalized photo gift by including a photo significant to the two of you.  Or, send a video with a personalized message that shows how much you care.  <br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, anywhere, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, make a purchase as you normally would and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is used in full.<br><br>FEATURES:\u2022 Thoughtful gift experience<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment.<br><br>\u2022 No more unused gift cards<br><br>$1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app! Your feedback is very important to us. GiftYa | The thought that counts<br><br>DOWNLOAD GiftYa today and become the most thoughtful egifter the world has ever seen!",

Introducing GiftYa, the gifting app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way.  Gift card apps similar to GiftYa often involve buying gift cards that either don\u2019t work or never get sent to the right email.  We\u2019ve ensured these annoying problems don\u2019t happen (and never do again!).  <br><br>With GiftYa, you simply connect your credit/debit card and send gift cards (a GiftYa) to your friends and family through text.  Unlike email, which can lead to mistaken identity in delivery, phone numbers are very difficult to get wrong.  Once you send someone a GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.  Once someone purchases with the card they\u2019ve linked, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa virtual wallet.<br><br>The best part?  With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business.  Now, gift cards aren\u2019t just acceptable at major chains; you can send giftcards for Starbucks or to the small cafe down the road.  It\u2019s even more widely accepted than a visa gift card!    <br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>It\u2019s the thought that counts.  Before, people only bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions.  Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.  Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message.  It can be used as a simple gift for graduation.  Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for [something clever].<br><br>GiftYa does more than just make your e gift card experience easier.  It also makes it more meaningful.

Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family! Sending gift cards via email can lead to mistakes in delivery - phone numbers are easier to enter accurately and are less cluttered with messages. They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa\u2019s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That\u2019s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore!

It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.

Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family! Sending gift cards via email can lead to mistakes in delivery - phone numbers are easier to enter accurately and are less cluttered with messages. They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa\u2019s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That\u2019s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore! You can use GiftYa to send giftcards to Starbucks or that small cafe down the road serving your friend&#39;s favorite chai latte. GiftYa is even more widely accepted than a Visa card! It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5. If It\u2019s the thought that counts, then let people know you are thinking of them! Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message. Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for whatever graduation shenanigans they have planned! Send something clever or cute to your sweetheart in the middle of their day just to let them know you\u2019re thinking of them! GiftYa makes your e-gifts a breeze!

From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family!

They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds.

It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.

They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card.

    "descriptionHtml": "GiftYa The thought that counts! Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family! Sending gift cards via email can lead to mistakes in delivery - phone numbers are easier to enter accurately and are less cluttered with messages. They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa\u2019s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That\u2019s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore! You can use GiftYa to send giftcards to Starbucks or that small cafe down the road serving your friend&#39;s favorite chai latte. GiftYa is even more widely accepted than a Visa card! It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5. If It\u2019s the thought that counts, then let people know you are thinking of them! Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message. Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for whatever graduation shenanigans they have planned! Send something clever or cute to your sweetheart in the middle of their day just to let them know you\u2019re thinking of them! GiftYa makes your e-gifts a breeze! Make your GiftYa more meaningful when set and send personalized card photos - Or send a video with a message that shows how much you care.<br><br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, purchase as you usually would, and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is completely used.<br><br>GET STARTED<br><br>Get started with GiftYa and make the thought count!<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment. $1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family! Sending gift cards via email can lead to mistakes in delivery - phone numbers are easier to enter accurately and are less cluttered with messages. They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa\u2019s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That\u2019s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore!

It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5.

    "descriptionHtml": "GiftYa The thought that counts! Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family! Sending gift cards via email can lead to mistakes in delivery - phone numbers are easier to enter accurately and are less cluttered with messages. They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa\u2019s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That\u2019s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore! You can use GiftYa to send giftcards to Starbucks or that small cafe down the road serving your friend&#39;s favorite chai latte. GiftYa is even more widely accepted than a Visa card! It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5. If It\u2019s the thought that counts, then let people know you are thinking of them! Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message. Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for whatever graduation shenanigans they have planned! Send something clever or cute to your sweetheart in the middle of their day just to let them know you\u2019re thinking of them! GiftYa makes your e-gifts a breeze! Make your GiftYa more meaningful when set and send personalized card photos - Or send a video with a message that shows how much you care.<br><br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, purchase as you usually would, and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is completely used.<br><br>GET STARTED<br><br>Get started with GiftYa and make the thought count!<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment. $1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

    "descriptionHtml": "GiftYa The thought that counts! Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family! Sending gift cards via email can lead to mistakes in delivery - phone numbers are easier to enter accurately and are less cluttered with messages. They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa\u2019s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That\u2019s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore! You can use GiftYa to send giftcards to Starbucks or that small cafe down the road serving your friend&#39;s favorite chai latte. GiftYa is even more widely accepted than a Visa card! It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5. If It\u2019s the thought that counts, then let people know you are thinking of them! Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message. Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for whatever graduation shenanigans they have planned! Send something clever or cute to your sweetheart in the middle of their day just to let them know you\u2019re thinking of them! GiftYa makes your e-gifts a breeze! Make your GiftYa more meaningful when set and send personalized card photos - Or send a video with a message that shows how much you care.<br><br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, purchase as you usually would, and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is completely used.<br><br>GET STARTED<br><br>Get started with GiftYa and make the thought count!<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment. $1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family! Sending gift cards via email can lead to mistakes in delivery - phone numbers are easier to enter accurately and are less cluttered with messages. They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa\u2019s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That\u2019s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore! You can use GiftYa to send giftcards to Starbucks or that small cafe down the road serving your friend&#39;s favorite chai latte. GiftYa is even more widely accepted than a Visa card! It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5. If It\u2019s the thought that counts, then let people know you are thinking of them! Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message. Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for whatever graduation shenanigans they have planned! Send something clever or cute to your sweetheart in the middle of their day just to let them know you\u2019re thinking of them! GiftYa makes your e-gifts a breeze!

    "descriptionHtml": "GiftYa The thought that counts! Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family! Sending gift cards via email can lead to mistakes in delivery - phone numbers are easier to enter accurately and are less cluttered with messages. They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa\u2019s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That\u2019s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore! You can use GiftYa to send giftcards to Starbucks or that small cafe down the road serving your friend&#39;s favorite chai latte. GiftYa is even more widely accepted than a Visa card! It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5. If It\u2019s the thought that counts, then let people know you are thinking of them! Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message. Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for whatever graduation shenanigans they have planned! Send something clever or cute to your sweetheart in the middle of their day just to let them know you\u2019re thinking of them! GiftYa makes your e-gifts a breeze! Make your GiftYa more meaningful when set and send personalized card photos - Or send a video with a message that shows how much you care.<br><br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, purchase as you usually would, and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is completely used.<br><br>GET STARTED<br><br>Get started with GiftYa and make the thought count!<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment. $1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss.

They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card.

    "descriptionHtml": "GiftYa The thought that counts! Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family! Sending gift cards via email can lead to mistakes in delivery - phone numbers are easier to enter accurately and are less cluttered with messages. They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa\u2019s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That\u2019s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore! You can use GiftYa to send giftcards to Starbucks or that small cafe down the road serving your friend&#39;s favorite chai latte. GiftYa is even more widely accepted than a Visa card! It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5. If It\u2019s the thought that counts, then let people know you are thinking of them! Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message. Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for whatever graduation shenanigans they have planned! Send something clever or cute to your sweetheart in the middle of their day just to let them know you\u2019re thinking of them! GiftYa makes your e-gifts a breeze! Make your GiftYa more meaningful when set and send personalized card photos - Or send a video with a message that shows how much you care.<br><br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, purchase as you usually would, and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is completely used.<br><br>GET STARTED<br><br>Get started with GiftYa and make the thought count!<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment. $1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused. No more unused gift cards.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app!

Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family!

They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa\u2019s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That\u2019s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore! You can use GiftYa to send giftcards to Starbucks or that small cafe down the road serving your friend&#39;s favorite chai latte. GiftYa is even more widely accepted than a Visa card! It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5. If It\u2019s the thought that counts, then let people know you are thinking of them!

Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family! Sending gift cards via email can lead to mistakes in delivery - phone numbers are easier to enter accurately and are less cluttered with messages. They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa\u2019s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That\u2019s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore! You can use GiftYa to send giftcards to Starbucks or that small cafe down the road serving your friend&#39;s favorite chai latte. GiftYa is even more widely accepted than a Visa card! It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5. If It\u2019s the thought that counts, then let people know you are thinking of them! Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message. Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for whatever graduation shenanigans they have planned! Send something clever or cute to your sweetheart in the middle of their day just to let them know you\u2019re thinking of them! GiftYa makes your e-gifts a breeze!

Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family!

They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year!

    "descriptionHtml": "GiftYa The thought that counts! Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family! Sending gift cards via email can lead to mistakes in delivery - phone numbers are easier to enter accurately and are less cluttered with messages. They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa\u2019s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That\u2019s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore! You can use GiftYa to send giftcards to Starbucks or that small cafe down the road serving your friend&#39;s favorite chai latte. GiftYa is even more widely accepted than a Visa card! It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5. If It\u2019s the thought that counts, then let people know you are thinking of them! Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message. Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for whatever graduation shenanigans they have planned! Send something clever or cute to your sweetheart in the middle of their day just to let them know you\u2019re thinking of them! GiftYa makes your e-gifts a breeze! Make your GiftYa more meaningful when set and send personalized card photos - Or send a video with a message that shows how much you care.<br><br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, purchase as you usually would, and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is completely used.<br><br>GET STARTED<br><br>Get started with GiftYa and make the thought count!<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment. $1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

    "descriptionHtml": "GiftYa The thought that counts! Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family! Sending gift cards via email can lead to mistakes in delivery - phone numbers are easier to enter accurately and are less cluttered with messages. They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa\u2019s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That\u2019s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore! You can use GiftYa to send giftcards to Starbucks or that small cafe down the road serving your friend&#39;s favorite chai latte. GiftYa is even more widely accepted than a Visa card! It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5. If It\u2019s the thought that counts, then let people know you are thinking of them! Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message. Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for whatever graduation shenanigans they have planned! Send something clever or cute to your sweetheart in the middle of their day just to let them know you\u2019re thinking of them! GiftYa makes your e-gifts a breeze! Make your GiftYa more meaningful when set and send personalized card photos - Or send a video with a message that shows how much you care.<br><br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, purchase as you usually would, and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is completely used.<br><br>GET STARTED<br><br>Get started with GiftYa and make the thought count!<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment. $1 billion in gift cards go unused every year. GiftYa fixes that by linking the gift to the recipient\u2019s credit or debit card so the gift can\u2019t be lost and doesn\u2019t go unused. No more unused gift cards.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app!

    "descriptionHtml": "GiftYa The thought that counts! Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family!

They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa\u2019s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That\u2019s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore! You can use GiftYa to send giftcards to Starbucks or that small cafe down the road serving your friend&#39;s favorite chai latte. GiftYa is even more widely accepted than a Visa card! It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5. If It\u2019s the thought that counts, then let people know you are thinking of them! Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message. Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for whatever graduation shenanigans they have planned!

    "descriptionHtml": "GiftYa The thought that counts! Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family! Sending gift cards via email can lead to mistakes in delivery - phone numbers are easier to enter accurately and are less cluttered with messages. They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa\u2019s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That\u2019s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore! You can use GiftYa to send giftcards to Starbucks or that small cafe down the road serving your friend&#39;s favorite chai latte. GiftYa is even more widely accepted than a Visa card! It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5. If It\u2019s the thought that counts, then let people know you are thinking of them! Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message. Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for whatever graduation shenanigans they have planned! Send something clever or cute to your sweetheart in the middle of their day just to let them know you\u2019re thinking of them! GiftYa makes your e-gifts a breeze! Make your GiftYa more meaningful when set and send personalized card photos - Or send a video with a message that shows how much you care.<br><br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, purchase as you usually would, and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is completely used.<br><br>GET STARTED<br><br>Get started with GiftYa and make the thought count!<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment. $1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

No more unused gift cards.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app!

    "descriptionHtml": "GiftYa The thought that counts! Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don\u2019t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family! Sending gift cards via email can lead to mistakes in delivery - phone numbers are easier to enter accurately and are less cluttered with messages. They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won\u2019t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they\u2019ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa\u2019s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That\u2019s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore! You can use GiftYa to send giftcards to Starbucks or that small cafe down the road serving your friend&#39;s favorite chai latte. GiftYa is even more widely accepted than a Visa card! It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5. If It\u2019s the thought that counts, then let people know you are thinking of them! Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message. Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for whatever graduation shenanigans they have planned! Send something clever or cute to your sweetheart in the middle of their day just to let them know you\u2019re thinking of them! GiftYa makes your e-gifts a breeze! Make your GiftYa more meaningful when set and send personalized card photos - Or send a video with a message that shows how much you care.<br><br><br><br>HOW IT WORKS:<br><br>\u2022 Sending a GiftYa<br><br>Choose from almost any merchant, select the amount you want to give, personalize your GiftYa with a photo or video and send it to your recipient\u2019s phone within seconds.<br><br>\u2022 Receiving a GiftYa<br><br>Link the GiftYa you received to your credit or debit card in seconds, purchase as you usually would, and your account is credited the amount you spend until the GiftYa is completely used.<br><br>GET STARTED<br><br>Get started with GiftYa and make the thought count!<br><br>GiftYa uses the technology that\u2019s part of our everyday lives to send meaningful, personalized gifts in the moment. $1 billion in gift cards go unused every year.

No more unused gift cards.<br><br>Love GiftYa?<br><br>Please take a moment to review our app!

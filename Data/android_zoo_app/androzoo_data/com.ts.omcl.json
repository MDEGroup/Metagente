    "descriptionHtml": "India\u2019s wealth of human resources puts it in an enviable position. Specially because the quality of the resources available is very high. That there is a perennial demand for qualified Indians, irrespective of socio-political factors, is of no surprise.<br><br>The Government of Tamilnadu realized the multiple advantages in meeting this demand. More Indians working abroad would mean greater inflow of foreign exchange, improvement in the quality of life of the families of such Indians and a step towards solving ever-growing unemployment problem. Also there is a large number of Indians aspiring to work abroad.<br><br>The Overseas Manpower Corporation Limited (OMC) was thus incorporated in 1978. The chief objective being promoting employment of Indian manpower in foreign countries. Since incorporation, OMC has widened its scope to :<br><br>1. Function as recruiting agent of Indian manpower for Employment abroad.<br>2. Promote and establish joint industrial ventures aborad-on its own or on behalf of the Government.<br>3. Raise necessary financial resources from Indians abroad for projects in India.<br>4. Promote and takes steps to intensify exports of traditional and non-traditional items.<br>5. Sell tickets, on behalf of any or all foreign organizations providing air travels and transport service.<br>6. Provide Accident and Health Insurance coverage to Non-Resident Tamils.<br>7. Provide foreign exchange for persons recruited abroad for employment and for persons for traveling abroad.<br>OMC is a limited company established by Government of Tamil Nadu as early as 1978 with an authorized share capital of Rs. 50 lakhs. Its main object is to secure suitable overseas placements for the Indian professionals, skilled workers and others, who are desirous of securing jobs abroad. The Corporation also holds a valid registration certificate issued by Government of India, Ministry of Labour, as required under the Emigration Act, 1983, to perform the functions of a recruiting agency.<br>Reputation of being a Government organization which is in the field for the past 25 Years.<br>The corporation maintains computerized Data Bank in which bio-data of personnel in various disciplines right from Doctors and Engineers down to skilled and unskilled labourers are maintained.<br>Based on the client&#39;s requirement, OMC screens several candidates and gives the best suited shortlisted candidates.<br>In case of dearth of suitable candidates in its Data Bank, candidates are mobilized through advertisement.<br>In case of bulk requirement, the entire cost of advertisement is borne by OMC. In other cases, the cost will be shared at 50:50 between OMC and the client.<br>Being a Government organization, the advertisement released through OMC will be on Government concessional rates, thereby bringing down the cost of advertisement by 15-20%.<br>Besides advertisement or without resorting to advertisement, OMC issues press releases regarding recruitment, to be published as editorial matter free of cost in Newspapers published from Tamilnadu and adjoining states so as to mobilize candidates.<br>After the CV&#39;s are shortlisted, interview is arranged at Chennai in its own spacious premises.

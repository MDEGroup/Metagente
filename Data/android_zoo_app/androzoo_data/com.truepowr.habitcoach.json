    "descriptionHtml": "To lead a great, happy, healthy &amp; fulfilled life we always have to keep a close watch on our habits.<br>It is often said that you don&#39;t determine your life, but rather your habits determine your life.<br>If you have bad habits, it will negatively affect your relationships with your spouse, family and friends. Or it can affect your finances if you don&#39;t keep constantly track of your expenses or can&#39;t hold yourself back from doing binge-shopping. Or it can affect your health by not feeding your body what is best for your overall health.<br><br>However, if you have good habits, these will improve your overall well-being, relationships, finances and career.<br>But sometimes sticking to good habits can be very difficult at times. Especially when you&#39;re just starting out to get to used to habits. <br><br>You certainly had this feeling in your stomach when you were just starting out that it would be really easy and you had fun doing it, but then after doing it for a couple of weeks or months you started to lose your motivation and you didn&#39;t see that many results after a certain time.<br><br>Well, we had the same problems as you. So, we went out to search for solutions on how to stick to your good habits no matter how difficult it might be at times.<br>After consulting many successful people, reading many books we finally found a really cool and easy solution. <br><br>You might be a bit puzzled but the solution is simply having a calendar.<br>Every day you accomplish your habit, you mark a big red cross on the day in your calendar.<br>The goal is to build up a long chain with many red crosses without breaking this chain.<br>You see, every time you don&#39;t feel motivated do accomplish your habit for today, you simply take out your calendar and look at the nice long chain you&#39;ve been building up over the past days, weeks, months or even years and it will make you not to want to break the chain!<br>Additionally, the longer you do your positive habit the more momentum you build up. The more momentum you have the easier it is for you to keep going.<br><br>If you break the chain you lose your momentum. There is no going back. You will have to restart from day 1. So don&#39;t break the chain!<br><br>But what if you want to track multiple habits? If you were to buy one physical calendar per habit, you would have to carry each one of them around with you at all times and it can get quite messy.<br><br>That is why we created the Habit Coach. One app to track all your habits.<br>One app with a beautiful and easy-to-use design and some funny animations to keep you going.<br><br><br>Some more background information:<br>The idea with the calendar was originally proposed by a comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.<br>Other books which talk about how habits can improve your life are books like &quot;Eat that frog&quot; by Brian Tracy or &quot;The Compound Effect&quot; by Darren Hardy or &quot;Hustle: The Life Changing Effects of Constant Motion&quot; by Jesse Tevelow.<br>Additionally, well-accomplished speakers like Jim Rohn and Tony Robbins have also often repeated the power &amp; importance of positive habits.<br><br>According to one study it takes 21 days to successfully acquire a habit. However, other studies have found that this number is not very accurate and have found that it is more likely to take about 66 days.<br><br>Since then, it&#39;s been used to produce many successful people all around the world.<br>Let the next successful person be you. Accomplish whatever goal you set yourself to improve your life and the life of others around you.<br><br>Again, do not break the chain!<br>Keep on going, even when most people would quit.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Motivational Interviewing has now been found to help people find the motivation they need to make changes across a range of health and lifestyle behaviors. Developed by Professors Bill Miller and Steve Rollnick, MI has now been shown to help people change their smoking and drinking, diet, exercise and sport, work and study, and relationship behaviors. The key is to explore and resolve your ambivalence, your arguments for and against change, and then make a commitment to get started! MI Coach is facilitated by internationally recognized MI practitioner and trainer, Dr. Stan Steindl, via short instructional videos, key exercises and activities, and practical goal setting. Dive into MI Coach and get started on your journey towards lasting change!<br> <br> <br>WHO\u2019S IT FOR:<br> <br>MI Coach is designed for anyone who is considering making a change in their life and wanting to find their motivation. Whether that be everyday changes, such as finding the motivation to do the chores around the house, more significant life changes, such as moving jobs, or specific health behavior changes, such as smoking, drinking, diet, or exercise, MI Coach offer principles and practices to help.<br> <br> <br>HOW IT WORKS:<br> <br>MI Coach is rooted in the clinical rigor and evidence-based techniques of Motivational Interviewing (MI). MI is a longstanding approach to helping people change that has been scientifically evaluated over many years and across many behavioral change targets. Many published reviews and meta-analyses support the effectiveness of MI for people trying to make a change.<br> <br> <br>OUTCOMES:<br>MI Coach is designed to help people change. There is a behavioral focus on MI Coach outcomes, which are tracked across the period of the program via self-report questionnaires and self-monitoring. It is anticipated that MI Coach will contribute to increasing the user\u2019s confidence, importance, and readiness to change, their commitment to making a change, and the changes themselves.<br> <br> <br>FEATURES<br> <br>Learn about motivation, ambivalence, arguments for and against change, how to build confidence and importance for change, and how to make a commitment to change via MI principles, practices, and skills using video lessons and fun animations which help you to remember skills longer. <br> <br>MI Coach features seven core lessons with over 35 videos and associated exercises. Exercises are interactive and users can complete exercises, enter responses, and return to their responses later. Lessons and exercises can also be taken multiple times.<br> <br>MI Coach includes a user-friendly daily check-in for mood, behavior change measures, habit tracking; summary screens to check your progress; analytics to get insight into your own behavior as you learn new skills; community groups for peer discussion and learning; and the ability to share with therapists and care team.<br> <br>MI Coach exercises and practice ideas are similar to strategies used in health conversations with a health practitioner skilled in MI. There are over 35 exercises designed to be worked through in a way that motivation builds across the use of the app and culminates in making a commitment to change. You can also see a history of all the exercises that you did in the past to compare. Each of the exercises links directly to lessons and can be alternatively accessed through an Exercises page.<br> <br>Users can even access their favorites list where they can save exercises, skills, and meditations that they found particularly helpful or use frequently.<br> <br>Engage with other members of the MI Coach Community via Discussion Groups and Peer Support Groups. Provides a safe area for you to practice and integrate your motivation to change.<br> <br>DISCLAIMER:<br> <br>This is not a substitute for a Therapist or a Medical Professional.

    "descriptionHtml": "Motivational Interviewing has now been found to help people find the motivation they need to make changes across a range of health and lifestyle behaviors. Developed by Professors Bill Miller and Steve Rollnick, MI has now been shown to help people change their smoking and drinking, diet, exercise and sport, work and study, and relationship behaviors. The key is to explore and resolve your ambivalence, your arguments for and against change, and then make a commitment to get started! MI Coach is facilitated by internationally recognized MI practitioner and trainer, Dr. Stan Steindl, via short instructional videos, key exercises and activities, and practical goal setting. Dive into MI Coach and get started on your journey towards lasting change!<br> <br> <br>WHO\u2019S IT FOR:<br> <br>MI Coach is designed for anyone who is considering making a change in their life and wanting to find their motivation. Whether that be everyday changes, such as finding the motivation to do the chores around the house, more significant life changes, such as moving jobs, or specific health behavior changes, such as smoking, drinking, diet, or exercise, MI Coach offer principles and practices to help.<br> <br> <br>HOW IT WORKS:<br> <br>MI Coach is rooted in the clinical rigor and evidence-based techniques of Motivational Interviewing (MI). MI is a longstanding approach to helping people change that has been scientifically evaluated over many years and across many behavioral change targets. Many published reviews and meta-analyses support the effectiveness of MI for people trying to make a change.<br> <br> <br>OUTCOMES:<br>MI Coach is designed to help people change. There is a behavioral focus on MI Coach outcomes, which are tracked across the period of the program via self-report questionnaires and self-monitoring. It is anticipated that MI Coach will contribute to increasing the user\u2019s confidence, importance, and readiness to change, their commitment to making a change, and the changes themselves.<br> <br> <br>FEATURES<br> <br>Learn about motivation, ambivalence, arguments for and against change, how to build confidence and importance for change, and how to make a commitment to change via MI principles, practices, and skills using video lessons and fun animations which help you to remember skills longer. <br> <br>MI Coach features seven core lessons with over 35 videos and associated exercises. Exercises are interactive and users can complete exercises, enter responses, and return to their responses later. Lessons and exercises can also be taken multiple times.<br> <br>MI Coach includes a user-friendly daily check-in for mood, behavior change measures, habit tracking; summary screens to check your progress; analytics to get insight into your own behavior as you learn new skills; community groups for peer discussion and learning; and the ability to share with therapists and care team.<br> <br>MI Coach exercises and practice ideas are similar to strategies used in health conversations with a health practitioner skilled in MI. There are over 35 exercises designed to be worked through in a way that motivation builds across the use of the app and culminates in making a commitment to change. You can also see a history of all the exercises that you did in the past to compare. Each of the exercises links directly to lessons and can be alternatively accessed through an Exercises page.<br> <br>Users can even access their favorites list where they can save exercises, skills, and meditations that they found particularly helpful or use frequently.<br> <br>Engage with other members of the MI Coach Community via Discussion Groups and Peer Support Groups. Provides a safe area for you to practice and integrate your motivation to change.<br> <br>DISCLAIMER:<br> <br>This is not a substitute for a Therapist or a Medical Professional.

    "descriptionHtml": "Motivational Interviewing has now been found to help people find the motivation they need to make changes across a range of health and lifestyle behaviors. Developed by Professors Bill Miller and Steve Rollnick, MI has now been shown to help people change their smoking and drinking, diet, exercise and sport, work and study, and relationship behaviors. The key is to explore and resolve your ambivalence, your arguments for and against change, and then make a commitment to get started! MI Coach is facilitated by internationally recognized MI practitioner and trainer, Dr. Stan Steindl, via short instructional videos, key exercises and activities, and practical goal setting. Dive into MI Coach and get started on your journey towards lasting change!<br> <br> <br>WHO\u2019S IT FOR:<br> <br>MI Coach is designed for anyone who is considering making a change in their life and wanting to find their motivation. Whether that be everyday changes, such as finding the motivation to do the chores around the house, more significant life changes, such as moving jobs, or specific health behavior changes, such as smoking, drinking, diet, or exercise, MI Coach offer principles and practices to help.<br> <br> <br>HOW IT WORKS:<br> <br>MI Coach is rooted in the clinical rigor and evidence-based techniques of Motivational Interviewing (MI). MI is a longstanding approach to helping people change that has been scientifically evaluated over many years and across many behavioral change targets. Many published reviews and meta-analyses support the effectiveness of MI for people trying to make a change.<br> <br> <br>OUTCOMES:<br>MI Coach is designed to help people change. There is a behavioral focus on MI Coach outcomes, which are tracked across the period of the program via self-report questionnaires and self-monitoring. It is anticipated that MI Coach will contribute to increasing the user\u2019s confidence, importance, and readiness to change, their commitment to making a change, and the changes themselves.<br> <br> <br>FEATURES<br> <br>Learn about motivation, ambivalence, arguments for and against change, how to build confidence and importance for change, and how to make a commitment to change via MI principles, practices, and skills using video lessons and fun animations which help you to remember skills longer. <br> <br>MI Coach features seven core lessons with over 35 videos and associated exercises. Exercises are interactive and users can complete exercises, enter responses, and return to their responses later. Lessons and exercises can also be taken multiple times.<br> <br>MI Coach includes a user-friendly daily check-in for mood, behavior change measures, habit tracking; summary screens to check your progress; analytics to get insight into your own behavior as you learn new skills; community groups for peer discussion and learning; and the ability to share with therapists and care team.<br> <br>MI Coach exercises and practice ideas are similar to strategies used in health conversations with a health practitioner skilled in MI. There are over 35 exercises designed to be worked through in a way that motivation builds across the use of the app and culminates in making a commitment to change. You can also see a history of all the exercises that you did in the past to compare. Each of the exercises links directly to lessons and can be alternatively accessed through an Exercises page.<br> <br>Users can even access their favorites list where they can save exercises, skills, and meditations that they found particularly helpful or use frequently.<br> <br>Engage with other members of the MI Coach Community via Discussion Groups and Peer Support Groups. Provides a safe area for you to practice and integrate your motivation to change.<br> <br>DISCLAIMER:<br> <br>This is not a substitute for a Therapist or a Medical Professional.

    "descriptionHtml": "We have noticed people are facing difficulties in finding parking space. Some users park their vehicle beside roads and we have seen a lot of vehicles getting towed daily and sometimes getting stolen. In a developing nation like India, every other car owner is complaining about it.<br><br>This app will function in gated societies as well. Users can real-time monitor their parking slot and hence can see if someone else has parked in his/her slot or someone has sabotaged their property. Owner of a parking slot can add guests meaning their guest can park in his/her parking area.<br><br>In society, some people don&#39;t have a car but they are allocated a parking spot. Here, he can rent out that parking space to other users in need and can earn money.<br><br><br>- Users can search for parking space available in their vicinity and can book online(short to long duration). From booking till the time the user exits from the parking area, everything will be automated. No need to collect tickets from the parking guard. <br><br>- ParkSpot will automatically identify the user\u2019s car(via image processing) and will let him enter the parking space and will automatically detect the exit of the user. <br><br>- If a user forgets, where he/she had parked his/her car, then this app will help to locate their vehicle.<br><br>- If a user has free parking space available then he can rent out that space to other users and earn some extra penny. <br><br>- This app can help in locating stolen cars (by notifying the federal/state authorities).<br>\t<br>- The platform will keep track of vehicles in the parking area through imaging and will elevate issues if something went wrong(ex. user parks in a wrong location) and henceforth minimising the human intervention in the process(also resulting in a decrease in the required manpower)<br>\t<br>- ParkSpot guarantees the Site owners that only verified users can park in their spaces.<br><br>- It provides the users with the ease in searching for a right parking spot with apt safety and security features like real-time monitoring",

Some users park their vehicles beside roads and we have seen a lot of vehicles getting towed daily and sometimes getting stolen.

Your favorite parking app which is completely made in India, helping you find stress-free parking<br><br><br>This app will function in gated societies as well. Users can real-time monitor their parking slot and hence can see if someone else has parked in his/her slot or someone has sabotaged their property. The owner of a parking slot can add guests meaning their guest can park in his/her parking area.<br><br>In society, some people don&#39;t have a car but they are allocated a parking spot. Here, he can rent out that parking space to other users in need and can earn money.<br><br><hr><br><br><b>Use this app to </b>  <br><br>- Users can search for parking spaces available in their vicinity by using their current location or by entering an address and can book online(short to long duration). From booking till the time the user exits from the parking area, everything will be automated. No need to collect tickets from the parking guard. <br><br>- Get directions straight to space or an entrance <br><br>- ParkSpot will automatically identify the user\u2019s car(via image processing) and will let him enter the parking space and will automatically detect the exit of the user. <br><br>- If a user forgets, where he/she had parked his/her car, then this app will help to locate their vehicle.<br><br>- See parking space availability in real-time where available (NO Premium upgrade required).<br><br>- Find opening hours, up-to-date prices, payment methods, and more.<br><br>- Quickly narrow down parking choices using filters such as street parking only, free, credit cards accepted, covered, etc.<br><br>- If a user has free parking space available then he can rent out that space to other users and earn some extra penny. <br><br>- This app can help in locating stolen cars (by notifying the federal/state authorities).<br>\t<br>- The platform will keep track of vehicles in the parking area through imaging and will elevate issues if something went wrong(ex. user parks in a wrong location) and henceforth minimizing the human intervention in the process(also resulting in a decrease in the required manpower)<br>\t<br>- ParkSpot guarantees the Site owners that only verified users can park in their spaces.<br><br>- It provides the users with the ease in searching for the right parking spot with apt safety and security features like real-time monitoring<br><br><hr><br><br>If we don&#39;t have coverage in your area yet, please send us an email and we will keep you updated on our progress.

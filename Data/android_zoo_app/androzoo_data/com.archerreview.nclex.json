    "descriptionHtml": "MAKE QUALITY TEST PREP AFFORDABLE AGAIN!<br><br>Over the past decade, Archer Review has provided &quot;extremely affordable and highly successful&quot; courses to Medical Students and resident physicians to help them pass their licensing exams. Thousands of medical students and physicians have benefited from Archer&#39;s well researched exam preparation strategies.  We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams with an aim to help you prepare SMART but not just HARD. Archer has kept the prices of it&#39;s review courses same for medical students over the last 10 years with not a single price increase. Such is our commitment not to price-gouge the students and we plan to apply the same concept now to NCLEX Qbanks. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with a single motto to &quot;MAKE QUALITY TEST PREP AFFORDABLE AGAIN!&quot;. Within just 4 months of inception, about 15000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates. <br><br><br>Archer NCLEX Question bank includes:<br><br>- 2100 NCLEX-RN - format Questions on an interface to simulate the real NCLEX exam. NCLEX-PN Questions are being released very soon. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself in relation to your peers with regard to every single question and also, compare yourself in overall test. Your score compared to average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam. Assessment tests coming soon! <br><br>- Extremely thorough and detailed explanations (rationales) following each question. Several concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why certain option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master multiple concepts in short period of time and reinforces learning wile quizzing. <br><br>- Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some extremely important topics that are time and again tested on NCLEX. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon. Once again, Archer\u2019s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; simultaneously while quizzing you. <br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the real exam. <br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System wise breakdown and client-needs data presented. <br><br>- Review in Tutor or Test Modes. <br><br>- High-yield new questions added almost every week so you will see continuously increasing number of critically important question pool.",

These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon. Once again, Archer\u2019s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; simultaneously while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the real exam distribution. <br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas.

Review your performance, weak and strong areas from \u201cprevious tests\u201d button.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately whereas Timed mode to simulate real testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or just practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself in relation to your peers regarding every single question and, compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.

These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon. Once again, Archer\u2019s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; simultaneously while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the real exam distribution. <br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas.

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer NCLEX \u2013 with single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable Again! <br><br>Over the past decade, Archer Review has provided &quot;extremely affordable and highly successful&quot; courses to Medical Students and physicians. We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams with an aim to help you prepare SMART. Our commitment not to price-gouge the students. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just 7 months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates. <br><br>Archer NCLEX Question banks includes:<br>- Large number of questions: A.  2400 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the real NCLEX exam. B. 700 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions added almost every week so you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple readiness assessments/ mock exams with PASS PREDICTION accuracy approaching 99% for those scoring &quot;high&quot; or &quot;very high&quot; on four consecutive assessments <br><br>- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We want you to learn and master the concepts and become an amazing Nurse. If you are unhappy with the product, just e-mail us at support@archerreview.com and we will refund you fully.  Our pass rate is very high. If you used SURE-PASS three step approach along with Archer Content Video Review and did not pass, we will refund you fully or assist you for free with our products until you pass, whichever method you prefer. <br><br>- 99% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who take the exam after completing all 2400 questions and score 50 to 55% cumulative average, pass rates are hovering at extremely high 97%. If you completed Archer Qbank fully along with Archer content review and did not pass, send us an email with proof of failure and we will refund you fully. In addition, we will let you access the content and Q-bank FREE until you pass. <br><br>- The Power of Rationales: NCLEX-focus is the key! Extremely thorough and focused explanations (rationales). Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a certain option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master multiple concepts in a short period of time and reinforces learning while quizzing.<br><br>- Challenging Questions: The Qs challenge you. They are harder, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the rationale better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from \u201cprevious tests\u201d button.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately whereas Timed mode to simulate real testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or just practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself in relation to your peers regarding every single question and, compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam. Assessment tests coming soon.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some extremely important topics that are time and again tested on NCLEX. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon. Once again, Archer\u2019s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; simultaneously while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the real exam distribution. <br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System wise breakdown and client-needs data presented.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer NCLEX \u2013 with single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable Again! <br><br>Over the past decade, Archer Review has provided &quot;extremely affordable and highly successful&quot; courses to Medical Students and physicians. We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams with an aim to help you prepare SMART. Our commitment not to price-gouge the students. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just 7 months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates. <br><br>Archer NCLEX Question banks includes:<br>- Large number of questions: A.  2400 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the real NCLEX exam. B. 700 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions added almost every week so you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple readiness assessments/ mock exams with PASS PREDICTION accuracy approaching 99% for those scoring &quot;high&quot; or &quot;very high&quot; on four consecutive assessments <br><br>- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We want you to learn and master the concepts and become an amazing Nurse. If you are unhappy with the product, just e-mail us at support@archerreview.com and we will refund you fully.  Our pass rate is very high. If you used SURE-PASS three step approach along with Archer Content Video Review and did not pass, we will refund you fully or assist you for free with our products until you pass, whichever method you prefer. <br><br>- 99% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who take the exam after completing all 2400 questions and score 50 to 55% cumulative average, pass rates are hovering at extremely high 97%. If you completed Archer Qbank fully along with Archer content review and did not pass, send us an email with proof of failure and we will refund you fully. In addition, we will let you access the content and Q-bank FREE until you pass. <br><br>- The Power of Rationales: NCLEX-focus is the key! Extremely thorough and focused explanations (rationales). Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a certain option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master multiple concepts in a short period of time and reinforces learning while quizzing.<br><br>- Challenging Questions: The Qs challenge you. They are harder, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the rationale better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from \u201cprevious tests\u201d button.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately whereas Timed mode to simulate real testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or just practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself in relation to your peers regarding every single question and, compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam. Assessment tests coming soon.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some extremely important topics that are time and again tested on NCLEX. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon. Once again, Archer\u2019s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; simultaneously while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the real exam distribution. <br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System wise breakdown and client-needs data presented.",

Review your performance, weak and strong areas from \u201cprevious tests\u201d button.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately whereas Timed mode to simulate real testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or just practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself in relation to your peers regarding every single question and, compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam. Assessment tests coming soon.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some extremely important topics that are time and again tested on NCLEX. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon. Once again, Archer\u2019s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; simultaneously while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the real exam distribution. <br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas.

Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just 7 months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates. <br><br>Archer NCLEX Question banks includes:<br>- Large number of questions: A.  2400 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the real NCLEX exam. B. 700 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions added almost every week so you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple readiness assessments/ mock exams with PASS PREDICTION accuracy approaching 99% for those scoring &quot;high&quot; or &quot;very high&quot; on four consecutive assessments <br><br>- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We want you to learn and master the concepts and become an amazing Nurse. If you are unhappy with the product, just e-mail us at support@archerreview.com and we will refund you fully.

They are harder, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the rationale better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from \u201cprevious tests\u201d button.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately whereas Timed mode to simulate real testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or just practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself in relation to your peers regarding every single question and, compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam. Assessment tests coming soon.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some extremely important topics that are time and again tested on NCLEX. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon. Once again, Archer\u2019s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; simultaneously while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the real exam distribution. <br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System wise breakdown and client-needs data presented.",

They are harder, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the rationale better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from \u201cprevious tests\u201d button.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately whereas Timed mode to simulate real testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or just practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself in relation to your peers regarding every single question and, compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam. Assessment tests coming soon.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some extremely important topics that are time and again tested on NCLEX. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon. Once again, Archer\u2019s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; simultaneously while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the real exam distribution. <br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas.

These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon. Once again, Archer\u2019s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; simultaneously while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the real exam distribution. <br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas.

Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just 7 months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates. <br><br>Archer NCLEX Question banks includes:<br>- Large number of questions: A.  2400 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the real NCLEX exam. B. 700 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions added almost every week so you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple readiness assessments/ mock exams with PASS PREDICTION accuracy approaching 99% for those scoring &quot;high&quot; or &quot;very high&quot; on four consecutive assessments <br><br>- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We want you to learn and master the concepts and become an amazing Nurse. If you are unhappy with the product, just e-mail us at support@archerreview.com and we will refund you fully.

Review your performance, weak and strong areas from \u201cprevious tests\u201d button.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately whereas Timed mode to simulate real testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or just practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself in relation to your peers regarding every single question and, compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam. Assessment tests coming soon.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some extremely important topics that are time and again tested on NCLEX. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon. Once again, Archer\u2019s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; simultaneously while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the real exam distribution. <br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System wise breakdown and client-needs data presented.",

They are harder, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales.

Review your performance, weak and strong areas from \u201cprevious tests\u201d button.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately whereas Timed mode to simulate real testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or just practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself in relation to your peers regarding every single question and, compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam. Assessment tests coming soon.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some extremely important topics that are time and again tested on NCLEX. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon. Once again, Archer\u2019s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; simultaneously while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the real exam distribution. <br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas.

Review your performance, weak and strong areas from \u201cprevious tests\u201d button.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately whereas Timed mode to simulate real testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or just practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself in relation to your peers regarding every single question and, compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam. Assessment tests coming soon.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some extremely important topics that are time and again tested on NCLEX. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon. Once again, Archer\u2019s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; simultaneously while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the real exam distribution. <br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas.

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable Again!<br><br>Over the past decade, Archer Review has provided &quot;extremely affordable and highly successful&quot; courses to Medical Students and physicians. We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams intending to help you prepare SMART. Our commitment is not to price-gouge the students. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just seven months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates.<br><br>Archer NCLEX Question banks include:<br><br>- A large number of questions: A. 2800 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the actual NCLEX exam. B. 900 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We were hoping you could learn and master the concepts and become a fantastic Nurse. We stand by our pass guarantee for the SUREPASS combo package - We can extend your subscription free or refund if the student used the @SurePass combo, follow all the criteria (complete qbank; four consecutive highs in assessments, attend live review) and then still fail. If you are unhappy with the product, email us at support@archerreview.com within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund.<br><br>- 97% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who take the exam after completing all 2800 questions and score 50 to 55% cumulative average, pass rates are hovering at an extremely high 97%. If you completed Archer Qbank fully and did not pass, send us an email with proof of failure, and we will refund you fully. In addition, we will let you access the content and Q-bank FREE until you pass. Again, we want you to pass NCLEX.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master various concepts in a short period and reinforces learning while quizzing.<br><br>- Challenging Questions: The Qs challenge you. They are more complex, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from the &quot;previous tests&quot; button<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode to simulate the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. Rev<br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics that are repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data were presented.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable Again!<br><br>Over the past decade, Archer Review has provided &quot;extremely affordable and highly successful&quot; courses to Medical Students and physicians. We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams intending to help you prepare SMART. Our commitment is not to price-gouge the students. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just seven months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates.<br><br>Archer NCLEX Question banks include:<br><br>- A large number of questions: A. 2800 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the actual NCLEX exam. B. 900 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We were hoping you could learn and master the concepts and become a fantastic Nurse. We stand by our pass guarantee for the SUREPASS combo package - We can extend your subscription free or refund if the student used the @SurePass combo, follow all the criteria (complete qbank; four consecutive highs in assessments, attend live review) and then still fail. If you are unhappy with the product, email us at support@archerreview.com within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund.<br><br>- 97% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who take the exam after completing all 2800 questions and score 50 to 55% cumulative average, pass rates are hovering at an extremely high 97%. If you completed Archer Qbank fully and did not pass, send us an email with proof of failure, and we will refund you fully. In addition, we will let you access the content and Q-bank FREE until you pass. Again, we want you to pass NCLEX.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master various concepts in a short period and reinforces learning while quizzing.<br><br>- Challenging Questions: The Qs challenge you. They are more complex, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from the &quot;previous tests&quot; button<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode to simulate the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. Rev<br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics that are repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data were presented.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable Again!<br><br>Over the past decade, Archer Review has provided &quot;extremely affordable and highly successful&quot; courses to Medical Students and physicians. We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams intending to help you prepare SMART. Our commitment is not to price-gouge the students. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just seven months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates.<br><br>Archer NCLEX Question banks include:<br><br>- A large number of questions: A. 2800 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the actual NCLEX exam. B. 900 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We were hoping you could learn and master the concepts and become a fantastic Nurse. We stand by our pass guarantee for the SUREPASS combo package - We can extend your subscription free or refund if the student used the @SurePass combo, follow all the criteria (complete qbank; four consecutive highs in assessments, attend live review) and then still fail. If you are unhappy with the product, email us at support@archerreview.com within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund.<br><br>- 97% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who take the exam after completing all 2800 questions and score 50 to 55% cumulative average, pass rates are hovering at an extremely high 97%. If you completed Archer Qbank fully and did not pass, send us an email with proof of failure, and we will refund you fully. In addition, we will let you access the content and Q-bank FREE until you pass. Again, we want you to pass NCLEX.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master various concepts in a short period and reinforces learning while quizzing.<br><br>- Challenging Questions: The Qs challenge you. They are more complex, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from the &quot;previous tests&quot; button<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode to simulate the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. Rev<br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics that are repeatedly tested on NCLEX.

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable Again!<br><br>Over the past decade, Archer Review has provided &quot;extremely affordable and highly successful&quot; courses to Medical Students and physicians. We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams intending to help you prepare SMART. Our commitment is not to price-gouge the students. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just seven months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates.<br><br>Archer NCLEX Question banks include:<br><br>- A large number of questions: A. 2800 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the actual NCLEX exam. B. 900 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We were hoping you could learn and master the concepts and become a fantastic Nurse. We stand by our pass guarantee for the SUREPASS combo package - We can extend your subscription free or refund if the student used the @SurePass combo, follow all the criteria (complete qbank; four consecutive highs in assessments, attend live review) and then still fail. If you are unhappy with the product, email us at support@archerreview.com within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund.<br><br>- 97% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who take the exam after completing all 2800 questions and score 50 to 55% cumulative average, pass rates are hovering at an extremely high 97%. If you completed Archer Qbank fully and did not pass, send us an email with proof of failure, and we will refund you fully. In addition, we will let you access the content and Q-bank FREE until you pass. Again, we want you to pass NCLEX.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master various concepts in a short period and reinforces learning while quizzing.<br><br>- Challenging Questions: The Qs challenge you. They are more complex, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from the &quot;previous tests&quot; button<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode to simulate the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. Rev<br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics that are repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data were presented.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable Again!<br><br>Over the past decade, Archer Review has provided &quot;extremely affordable and highly successful&quot; courses to Medical Students and physicians. We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams intending to help you prepare SMART. Our commitment is not to price-gouge the students. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just seven months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates.<br><br>Archer NCLEX Question banks include:<br><br>- A large number of questions: A. 2800 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the actual NCLEX exam. B. 900 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We were hoping you could learn and master the concepts and become a fantastic Nurse. We stand by our pass guarantee for the SUREPASS combo package - We can extend your subscription free or refund if the student used the @SurePass combo, follow all the criteria (complete qbank; four consecutive highs in assessments, attend live review) and then still fail. If you are unhappy with the product, email us at support@archerreview.com within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund.<br><br>- 97% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who take the exam after completing all 2800 questions and score 50 to 55% cumulative average, pass rates are hovering at an extremely high 97%. If you completed Archer Qbank fully and did not pass, send us an email with proof of failure, and we will refund you fully. In addition, we will let you access the content and Q-bank FREE until you pass. Again, we want you to pass NCLEX.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master various concepts in a short period and reinforces learning while quizzing.<br><br>- Challenging Questions: The Qs challenge you. They are more complex, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from the &quot;previous tests&quot; button<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode to simulate the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. Rev<br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics that are repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data were presented.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable Again!<br><br>Over the past decade, Archer Review has provided &quot;extremely affordable and highly successful&quot; courses to Medical Students and physicians. We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams intending to help you prepare SMART. Our commitment is not to price-gouge the students. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just seven months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates.<br><br>Archer NCLEX Question banks include:<br><br>- A large number of questions: A. 2800 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the actual NCLEX exam. B. 900 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We were hoping you could learn and master the concepts and become a fantastic Nurse. We stand by our pass guarantee for the SUREPASS combo package - We can extend your subscription free or refund if the student used the @SurePass combo, follow all the criteria (complete qbank; four consecutive highs in assessments, attend live review) and then still fail. If you are unhappy with the product, email us at support@archerreview.com within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund.<br><br>- 97% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who take the exam after completing all 2800 questions and score 50 to 55% cumulative average, pass rates are hovering at an extremely high 97%. If you completed Archer Qbank fully and did not pass, send us an email with proof of failure, and we will refund you fully. In addition, we will let you access the content and Q-bank FREE until you pass. Again, we want you to pass NCLEX.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master various concepts in a short period and reinforces learning while quizzing.<br><br>- Challenging Questions: The Qs challenge you. They are more complex, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from the &quot;previous tests&quot; button<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode to simulate the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. Rev<br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics that are repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data were presented.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable Again!<br><br>Over the past decade, Archer Review has provided &quot;extremely affordable and highly successful&quot; courses to Medical Students and physicians. We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams intending to help you prepare SMART. Our commitment is not to price-gouge the students. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just seven months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates.<br><br>Archer NCLEX Question banks include:<br><br>- A large number of questions: A. 2800 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the actual NCLEX exam. B. 900 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We were hoping you could learn and master the concepts and become a fantastic Nurse. We stand by our pass guarantee for the SUREPASS combo package - We can extend your subscription free or refund if the student used the @SurePass combo, follow all the criteria (complete qbank; four consecutive highs in assessments, attend live review) and then still fail. If you are unhappy with the product, email us at support@archerreview.com within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund.<br><br>- 97% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who take the exam after completing all 2800 questions and score 50 to 55% cumulative average, pass rates are hovering at an extremely high 97%. If you completed Archer Qbank fully and did not pass, send us an email with proof of failure, and we will refund you fully. In addition, we will let you access the content and Q-bank FREE until you pass. Again, we want you to pass NCLEX.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master various concepts in a short period and reinforces learning while quizzing.<br><br>- Challenging Questions: The Qs challenge you. They are more complex, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from the &quot;previous tests&quot; button<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode to simulate the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. Rev<br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics that are repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data were presented.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable Again!<br><br>Over the past decade, Archer Review has provided &quot;extremely affordable and highly successful&quot; courses to Medical Students and physicians. We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams intending to help you prepare SMART. Our commitment is not to price-gouge the students. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just seven months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates.<br><br>Archer NCLEX Question banks include:<br><br>- A large number of questions: A. 2800 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the actual NCLEX exam. B. 900 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We were hoping you could learn and master the concepts and become a fantastic Nurse. We stand by our pass guarantee for the SUREPASS combo package - We can extend your subscription free or refund if the student used the @SurePass combo, follow all the criteria (complete qbank; four consecutive highs in assessments, attend live review) and then still fail. If you are unhappy with the product, email us at support@archerreview.com within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund.<br><br>- 97% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who take the exam after completing all 2800 questions and score 50 to 55% cumulative average, pass rates are hovering at an extremely high 97%. If you completed Archer Qbank fully and did not pass, send us an email with proof of failure, and we will refund you fully. In addition, we will let you access the content and Q-bank FREE until you pass. Again, we want you to pass NCLEX.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master various concepts in a short period and reinforces learning while quizzing.<br><br>- Challenging Questions: The Qs challenge you. They are more complex, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from the &quot;previous tests&quot; button<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode to simulate the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. Rev<br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics that are repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data were presented.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable Again!<br><br>Over the past decade, Archer Review has provided &quot;extremely affordable and highly successful&quot; courses to Medical Students and physicians. We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams intending to help you prepare SMART. Our commitment is not to price-gouge the students. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just seven months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates.<br><br>Archer NCLEX Question banks include:<br><br>- A large number of questions: A. 2800 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the actual NCLEX exam. B. 900 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We were hoping you could learn and master the concepts and become a fantastic Nurse. We stand by our pass guarantee for the SUREPASS combo package - We can extend your subscription free or refund if the student used the @SurePass combo, follow all the criteria (complete qbank; four consecutive highs in assessments, attend live review) and then still fail. If you are unhappy with the product, email us at support@archerreview.com within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund.<br><br>- 97% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who take the exam after completing all 2800 questions and score 50 to 55% cumulative average, pass rates are hovering at an extremely high 97%. If you completed Archer Qbank fully and did not pass, send us an email with proof of failure, and we will refund you fully. In addition, we will let you access the content and Q-bank FREE until you pass. Again, we want you to pass NCLEX.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master various concepts in a short period and reinforces learning while quizzing.<br><br>- Challenging Questions: The Qs challenge you. They are more complex, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from the &quot;previous tests&quot; button<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode to simulate the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. Rev<br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics that are repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data were presented.",

Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics that are repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas.

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable Again!<br><br>Over the past decade, Archer Review has provided &quot;extremely affordable and highly successful&quot; courses to Medical Students and physicians. We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams intending to help you prepare SMART. Our commitment is not to price-gouge the students. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just seven months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates.<br><br>Archer NCLEX Question banks include:<br><br>- A large number of questions: A. 2800 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the actual NCLEX exam. B. 900 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We were hoping you could learn and master the concepts and become a fantastic Nurse. We stand by our pass guarantee for the SUREPASS combo package - We can extend your subscription free or refund if the student used the @SurePass combo, follow all the criteria (complete qbank; four consecutive highs in assessments, attend live review) and then still fail. If you are unhappy with the product, email us at support@archerreview.com within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund.<br><br>- 97% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who take the exam after completing all 2800 questions and score 50 to 55% cumulative average, pass rates are hovering at an extremely high 97%. If you completed Archer Qbank fully and did not pass, send us an email with proof of failure, and we will refund you fully. In addition, we will let you access the content and Q-bank FREE until you pass. Again, we want you to pass NCLEX.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master various concepts in a short period and reinforces learning while quizzing.<br><br>- Challenging Questions: The Qs challenge you. They are more complex, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from the &quot;previous tests&quot; button<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode to simulate the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. Rev<br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics that are repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data were presented.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable Again!<br><br>Over the past decade, Archer Review has provided &quot;extremely affordable and highly successful&quot; courses to Medical Students and physicians. We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams intending to help you prepare SMART. Our commitment is not to price-gouge the students. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just seven months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates.<br><br>Archer NCLEX Question banks include:<br><br>- A large number of questions: A. 2800 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the actual NCLEX exam. B. 900 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We were hoping you could learn and master the concepts and become a fantastic Nurse. We stand by our pass guarantee for the SUREPASS combo package - We can extend your subscription free or refund if the student used the @SurePass combo, follow all the criteria (complete qbank; four consecutive highs in assessments, attend live review) and then still fail. If you are unhappy with the product, email us at support@archerreview.com within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund.<br><br>- 97% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who take the exam after completing all 2800 questions and score 50 to 55% cumulative average, pass rates are hovering at an extremely high 97%. If you completed Archer Qbank fully and did not pass, send us an email with proof of failure, and we will refund you fully. In addition, we will let you access the content and Q-bank FREE until you pass. Again, we want you to pass NCLEX.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master various concepts in a short period and reinforces learning while quizzing.<br><br>- Challenging Questions: The Qs challenge you. They are more complex, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from the &quot;previous tests&quot; button<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode to simulate the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. Rev<br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics that are repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data were presented.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable Again!<br><br>Over the past decade, Archer Review has provided &quot;extremely affordable and highly successful&quot; courses to Medical Students and physicians. We apply the same high-yield focused strategy to NCLEX exams intending to help you prepare SMART. Our commitment is not to price-gouge the students. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Within just seven months of inception, about 30000 Nurses have taken Archer QBanks and have reported high pass rates.<br><br>Archer NCLEX Question banks include:<br><br>- A large number of questions: A. 2800 NCLEX-RN Questions on an interface to simulate the actual NCLEX exam. B. 900 NCLEX-PN questions currently and growing in count every day. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Money-back guarantee: We believe in transparency. We were hoping you could learn and master the concepts and become a fantastic Nurse. We stand by our pass guarantee for the SUREPASS combo package - We can extend your subscription free or refund if the student used the @SurePass combo, follow all the criteria (complete qbank; four consecutive highs in assessments, attend live review) and then still fail. If you are unhappy with the product, email us at support@archerreview.com within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund.<br><br>- 97% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who take the exam after completing all 2800 questions and score 50 to 55% cumulative average, pass rates are hovering at an extremely high 97%. If you completed Archer Qbank fully and did not pass, send us an email with proof of failure, and we will refund you fully. In addition, we will let you access the content and Q-bank FREE until you pass. Again, we want you to pass NCLEX.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. This strategy helps you master various concepts in a short period and reinforces learning while quizzing.<br><br>- Challenging Questions: The Qs challenge you. They are more complex, but the idea is to challenge you and then present you with master rationales. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you real hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong areas from the &quot;previous tests&quot; button<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode to simulate the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via. System-based question review. Rev<br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; gives you data to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and compare yourself in the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Video Rationales: Our unique &quot;Video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics that are repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s master strategy is to help the concepts stick with you well through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you. These Video rationales will be expanded to more and more Qs soon.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: Single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data were presented.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX.

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere.

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information.

While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation.

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX.

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Archer Next-Generation NCLEX \u2013 with a single motto to Make Quality Test Prep Affordable &amp; Effective!<br><br><br>Over several years, Archer Review has provided affordable and successful courses to nursing students, medical students, and physicians. Archer applies a high-yield focused test preparation strategy to help you prepare SMART. Good test-prep courses need not be pricey, and Archer is moving forward with this single motto. Since 2020, about 200,000 nursing students and nurses have trusted Archer Review and have reported high pass rates.<br><br><br>Archer NCLEX products include:<br><br>1. Question banks <br><br>2. On-demand videos <br><br>3. Combos (question banks and on-demand videos)<br><br><br><br>- A large number of questions (next-generation NCLEX items and legacy items spread out according to the new NGN-NCLEX pattern): <br><br>A. 2950+ NCLEX-RN questions on an interface that mimics the real NCLEX exam <br><br>B. 1100+ NCLEX-PN questions. High-yield new questions are added almost every week so that you will see a continuously increasing number of critically important questions.<br><br>- Multiple prediction assessments: Multiple readiness assessments can be launched. Assessing yourself frequently helps you know your readiness throughout your prep compared to assessing just at the end of the prep. <br><br>- Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) mode: Like NCLEX, CAT adapts to your performance and sequentially delivers questions to simulate NCLEX. <br><br>- 98% pass rate confidence: Among the Archer Q-bank users who took the exam after completing all the sure-pass criteria and achieving consecutive highs on four assessments, the pass rate has been 98%.<br><br>- The Power of Rationales: In-depth and detailed explanations (rationales). Additional information sections provide in-depth details, while the body of the rationale provides focused information. Multiple concepts are explained in a single question, so you understand why a specific option is incorrect. <br><br>- Challenging Questions: The questions will challenge you. While the questions can be challenging, the goal is to challenge you and explain the subject within the explanation. Learning is enhanced under stress \u2013 we use this scientific concept to challenge you hard, so you study and retain the explanation better. Review your performance, weak and strong, under previous tests.<br><br>- Tutor/ Test and Timed modes: Tutor mode allows you to see the rationale immediately, whereas Timed mode simulates the actual testing atmosphere. Create comprehensive tests on the go or practice questions in your weak areas via\u2014system-based question review.  <br><br>- Ability to launch tests based on NCSBN client need areas. This is particularly useful for those with prior NCLEX attempts to launch and practice tests in their weak client-need areas. <br><br>- &quot;Peer Stats&quot; provides you with information to compare yourself with your peers regarding every question and the overall test. Your score compared to the average peer score lets you assess your readiness for the exam.<br><br>- Videos: Our unique &quot;video rationales&quot; accompany some essential topics repeatedly tested on NCLEX. Once again, Archer&#39;s strategy is to help you retain concepts through &quot;audio-visual reinforcement&quot; while quizzing you.<br><br>- Multiple test item types: All next-generation NCLEX item types (unfolding case studies, other standalone new NGN items), single choice, SATA (select all that apply), fill in the blanks, ordered sequence, audios/ images questions with a large proportion of questions being SATA to reflect the actual exam distribution.<br><br>- Performance dashboards to analyze your weak and strong areas. System-wise breakdown and client-needs data are presented.<br><br><br><br>Combo products include <br><br>- All features of the Q-bank <br><br>- On-Demand videos covering every client need area tested on the NCLEX. Videos are updated after every live review. Both the videos of live review crash courses and topic-wise videos are included in the On-Demand bundles. <br><br>- Money-back guarantee (SurePass combo users only)",

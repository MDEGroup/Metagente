Funds in Checking eligible up to $250k FDIC insurance. Betterment Checking available through Betterment Financial LLC. Neither Betterment Financial LLC, nor any affiliates, is a bank. Betterment Financial LLC reimburses ATM fees and Visa\u00ae 1% foreign transaction fee everywhere Visa is accepted. <br>Cash Reserve (\u201cCR\u201d) offered by Betterment LLC. Clients of Betterment LLC participate in CR through their brokerage account held at Betterment Securities. Neither Betterment LLC nor any affiliates is a bank. Through CR, clients&#39; funds are deposited into one or more banks (&quot;Program Banks&quot;) where funds earn a variable interest rate and are eligible for FDIC insurance. CR provides Betterment clients with the opportunity to earn interest on cash intended to purchase securities through Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities. CR should not be viewed as a long-term investment option.<br>Funds held in brokerage accounts not FDIC\u2010insured but protected by SIPC. Funds in transit to or from Program Banks generally not FDIC\u2010insured but protected by SIPC except when held in a sweep account following a deposit or prior to a withdrawal, at which time funds are eligible for FDIC insurance but not protected by SIPC. See Betterment Client Agreements for details. Funds deposited into CR eligible up to $1M ($2M for joint accounts) of FDIC insurance once funds reach one or more Program Banks (up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity\u2014e.g., individual or joint\u2014at up to 4 Program Banks). Even if there are more than 4 Program Banks, clients will not necessarily have deposits allocated in a manner that will provide FDIC insurance above $1M (or $2M for joint accounts). The FDIC calculates the insurance limits based on all accounts held in the same insurable capacity at a bank, not just cash in CR. If clients elect to exclude one or more Program Banks from receiving deposits, the amount of FDIC insurance available through CR may be lower. Clients are responsible for monitoring total assets at each Program Bank, incl. existing deposits held at Program Banks outside of CR, to ensure FDIC insurance limits are not exceeded, which could result in some funds being uninsured. For more information on FDIC insurance please visit www.FDIC.gov. Deposits held in Program Banks not protected by SIPC.

Funds in Checking eligible up to $250k FDIC insurance. Betterment Checking available through Betterment Financial LLC. Neither Betterment Financial LLC, nor any affiliates, is a bank. Betterment Financial LLC reimburses ATM fees and Visa\u00ae 1% foreign transaction fee everywhere Visa is accepted. <br>Cash Reserve (\u201cCR\u201d) offered by Betterment LLC. Clients of Betterment LLC participate in CR through their brokerage account held at Betterment Securities. Neither Betterment LLC nor any affiliates is a bank. Through CR, clients&#39; funds are deposited into one or more banks (&quot;Program Banks&quot;) where funds earn a variable interest rate and are eligible for FDIC insurance. CR provides Betterment clients with the opportunity to earn interest on cash intended to purchase securities through Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities. CR should not be viewed as a long-term investment option.<br>Funds held in brokerage accounts not FDIC\u2010insured but protected by SIPC. Funds in transit to or from Program Banks generally not FDIC\u2010insured but protected by SIPC except when held in a sweep account following a deposit or prior to a withdrawal, at which time funds are eligible for FDIC insurance but not protected by SIPC. See Betterment Client Agreements for details. Funds deposited into CR eligible up to $1M ($2M for joint accounts) of FDIC insurance once funds reach one or more Program Banks (up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity\u2014e.g., individual or joint\u2014at up to 4 Program Banks). Even if there are more than 4 Program Banks, clients will not necessarily have deposits allocated in a manner that will provide FDIC insurance above $1M (or $2M for joint accounts). The FDIC calculates the insurance limits based on all accounts held in the same insurable capacity at a bank, not just cash in CR. If clients elect to exclude one or more Program Banks from receiving deposits, the amount of FDIC insurance available through CR may be lower. Clients are responsible for monitoring total assets at each Program Bank, incl. existing deposits held at Program Banks outside of CR, to ensure FDIC insurance limits are not exceeded, which could result in some funds being uninsured. For more information on FDIC insurance please visit www.FDIC.gov. Deposits held in Program Banks not protected by SIPC.

CR provides Betterment clients with the opportunity to earn interest on cash intended to purchase securities through Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities. CR should not be viewed as a long-term investment option.<br>Funds held in brokerage accounts not FDIC\u2010insured but protected by SIPC. Funds in transit to or from Program Banks generally not FDIC\u2010insured but protected by SIPC except when held in a sweep account following a deposit or prior to a withdrawal, at which time funds are eligible for FDIC insurance but not protected by SIPC. See Betterment Client Agreements for details. Funds deposited into CR eligible up to $1M ($2M for joint accounts) of FDIC insurance once funds reach one or more Program Banks (up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity\u2014e.g., individual or joint\u2014at up to 4 Program Banks). Even if there are more than 4 Program Banks, clients will not necessarily have deposits allocated in a manner that will provide FDIC insurance above $1M (or $2M for joint accounts). The FDIC calculates the insurance limits based on all accounts held in the same insurable capacity at a bank, not just cash in CR. If clients elect to exclude one or more Program Banks from receiving deposits, the amount of FDIC insurance available through CR may be lower. Clients are responsible for monitoring total assets at each Program Bank, incl. existing deposits held at Program Banks outside of CR, to ensure FDIC insurance limits are not exceeded, which could result in some funds being uninsured.

Funds in Checking eligible up to $250k FDIC insurance. Betterment Checking available through Betterment Financial LLC. Neither Betterment Financial LLC, nor any affiliates, is a bank. Betterment Financial LLC reimburses ATM fees and Visa\u00ae 1% foreign transaction fee everywhere Visa is accepted. <br>Cash Reserve (\u201cCR\u201d) offered by Betterment LLC. Clients of Betterment LLC participate in CR through their brokerage account held at Betterment Securities. Neither Betterment LLC nor any affiliates is a bank. Through CR, clients&#39; funds are deposited into one or more banks (&quot;Program Banks&quot;) where funds earn a variable interest rate and are eligible for FDIC insurance. CR provides Betterment clients with the opportunity to earn interest on cash intended to purchase securities through Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities. CR should not be viewed as a long-term investment option.<br>Funds held in brokerage accounts not FDIC\u2010insured but protected by SIPC. Funds in transit to or from Program Banks generally not FDIC\u2010insured but protected by SIPC except when held in a sweep account following a deposit or prior to a withdrawal, at which time funds are eligible for FDIC insurance but not protected by SIPC. See Betterment Client Agreements for details. Funds deposited into CR eligible up to $1M ($2M for joint accounts) of FDIC insurance once funds reach one or more Program Banks (up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity\u2014e.g., individual or joint\u2014at up to 4 Program Banks). Even if there are more than 4 Program Banks, clients will not necessarily have deposits allocated in a manner that will provide FDIC insurance above $1M (or $2M for joint accounts). The FDIC calculates the insurance limits based on all accounts held in the same insurable capacity at a bank, not just cash in CR. If clients elect to exclude one or more Program Banks from receiving deposits, the amount of FDIC insurance available through CR may be lower. Clients are responsible for monitoring total assets at each Program Bank, incl. existing deposits held at Program Banks outside of CR, to ensure FDIC insurance limits are not exceeded, which could result in some funds being uninsured. For more information on FDIC insurance please visit www.FDIC.gov. Deposits held in Program Banks not protected by SIPC.

If clients elect to exclude one or more Program Banks from receiving deposits, the amount of FDIC insurance available through CR may be lower. Clients are responsible for monitoring total assets at each Program Bank, incl. existing deposits held at Program Banks outside of CR, to ensure FDIC insurance limits are not exceeded, which could result in some funds being uninsured.

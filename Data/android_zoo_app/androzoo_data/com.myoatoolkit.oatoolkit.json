    "descriptionHtml": "My OA Toolkit (OAT) is an exciting new OA App to help members of Overeaters Anonymous while on the go! <br><br>You can use My OA Toolkit&#39;s Food Journal as a your Plan of Eating Tool for the day or as a way to log your food throughout your day and turn your food over to your sponsor at the end of the day.<br><br>You can also use your OAT Food Journal if you become irritable, restless, or discontent throughout your day to get those feelings out of your head and in your journal. It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>\u2022 Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.<br><br>There are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA&#39;s Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.<br>Source:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html<br><br><br>\u2022 Gratitude List <br>If you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  <br><br>* Hardship Discounts Available <br><br>In 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:<br>1. Abstinence: The act of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.<br>2. Recovery: Removal of the need to engage in compulsive eating behaviors.<br><br>Spiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is achieved through working and living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step Program.<br><br> * Permission to use the OA name granted by Overeaters Anonymous, Inc.

In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life.

    "descriptionHtml": "My OA Toolkit (OAT) is an exciting new OA App to help members of Overeaters Anonymous while on the go! <br><br>You can use My OA Toolkit&#39;s Food Journal as a your Plan of Eating Tool for the day or as a way to log your food throughout your day and turn your food over to your sponsor at the end of the day.<br><br>You can also use your OAT Food Journal if you become irritable, restless, or discontent throughout your day to get those feelings out of your head and in your journal. It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>\u2022 Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.<br><br>There are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA&#39;s Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.<br>Source:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html<br><br><br>\u2022 Gratitude List <br>If you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  <br><br>* Hardship Discounts Available <br><br>In 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:<br>1. Abstinence: The act of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.<br>2. Recovery: Removal of the need to engage in compulsive eating behaviors.<br><br>Spiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is achieved through working and living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step Program.<br><br> * Permission to use the OA name granted by Overeaters Anonymous, Inc.

    "descriptionHtml": "My OA Toolkit (OAT) is an exciting new OA App to help members of Overeaters Anonymous while on the go! <br><br>You can use My OA Toolkit&#39;s Food Journal as a your Plan of Eating Tool for the day or as a way to log your food throughout your day and turn your food over to your sponsor at the end of the day.<br><br>You can also use your OAT Food Journal if you become irritable, restless, or discontent throughout your day to get those feelings out of your head and in your journal. It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>\u2022 Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.<br><br>There are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA&#39;s Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.<br>Source:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html<br><br><br>\u2022 Gratitude List <br>If you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  <br><br>* Hardship Discounts Available <br><br>In 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:<br>1. Abstinence: The act of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.<br>2. Recovery: Removal of the need to engage in compulsive eating behaviors.<br><br>Spiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is achieved through working and living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step Program.<br><br> * Permission to use the OA name granted by Overeaters Anonymous, Inc.

    "descriptionHtml": "My OA Toolkit (OAT) is an exciting new OA App to help members of Overeaters Anonymous while on the go! <br><br>You can use My OA Toolkit&#39;s Food Journal as a your Plan of Eating Tool for the day or as a way to log your food throughout your day and turn your food over to your sponsor at the end of the day.<br><br>You can also use your OAT Food Journal if you become irritable, restless, or discontent throughout your day to get those feelings out of your head and in your journal. It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>\u2022 Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.<br><br>There are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA&#39;s Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.<br>Source:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html<br><br><br>\u2022 Gratitude List <br>If you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  <br><br>* Hardship Discounts Available <br><br>In 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:<br>1. Abstinence: The act of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.<br>2. Recovery: Removal of the need to engage in compulsive eating behaviors.<br><br>Spiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is achieved through working and living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step Program.<br><br> * Permission to use the OA name granted by Overeaters Anonymous, Inc.

For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician.

    "descriptionHtml": "My OA Toolkit (OAT) is an exciting new OA App to help members of Overeaters Anonymous while on the go! <br><br>You can use My OA Toolkit&#39;s Food Journal as a your Plan of Eating Tool for the day or as a way to log your food throughout your day and turn your food over to your sponsor at the end of the day.<br><br>You can also use your OAT Food Journal if you become irritable, restless, or discontent throughout your day to get those feelings out of your head and in your journal. It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>\u2022 Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.<br><br>There are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA&#39;s Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.<br>Source:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html<br><br><br>\u2022 Gratitude List <br>If you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  <br><br>* Hardship Discounts Available <br><br>In 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:<br>1. Abstinence: The act of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.<br>2. Recovery: Removal of the need to engage in compulsive eating behaviors.<br><br>Spiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is achieved through working and living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step Program.<br><br> * Permission to use the OA name granted by Overeaters Anonymous, Inc.

    "descriptionHtml": "My OA Toolkit (OAT) is an exciting new OA App to help members of Overeaters Anonymous while on the go! <br><br>You can use My OA Toolkit&#39;s Food Journal as a your Plan of Eating Tool for the day or as a way to log your food throughout your day and turn your food over to your sponsor at the end of the day.<br><br>You can also use your OAT Food Journal if you become irritable, restless, or discontent throughout your day to get those feelings out of your head and in your journal. It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>\u2022 Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.<br><br>There are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA&#39;s Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.<br>Source:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html<br><br><br>\u2022 Gratitude List <br>If you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  <br><br>* Hardship Discounts Available <br><br>In 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:<br>1. Abstinence: The act of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.<br>2. Recovery: Removal of the need to engage in compulsive eating behaviors.<br><br>Spiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is achieved through working and living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step Program.<br><br> * Permission to use the OA name granted by Overeaters Anonymous, Inc.

    "descriptionHtml": "My OA Toolkit (OAT) is an exciting new OA App to help members of Overeaters Anonymous while on the go! <br><br>You can use My OA Toolkit&#39;s Food Journal as a your Plan of Eating Tool for the day or as a way to log your food throughout your day and turn your food over to your sponsor at the end of the day.<br><br>You can also use your OAT Food Journal if you become irritable, restless, or discontent throughout your day to get those feelings out of your head and in your journal. It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>\u2022 Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.<br><br>There are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA&#39;s Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.<br>Source:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html<br><br><br>\u2022 Gratitude List <br>If you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  <br><br>* Hardship Discounts Available <br><br>In 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:<br>1. Abstinence: The act of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.<br>2. Recovery: Removal of the need to engage in compulsive eating behaviors.<br><br>Spiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is achieved through working and living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step Program.<br><br> * Permission to use the OA name granted by Overeaters Anonymous, Inc.

    "descriptionHtml": "My OA Toolkit (OAT) is an exciting new OA App to help members of Overeaters Anonymous while on the go! <br><br>You can use My OA Toolkit&#39;s Food Journal as a your Plan of Eating Tool for the day or as a way to log your food throughout your day and turn your food over to your sponsor at the end of the day.<br><br>You can also use your OAT Food Journal if you become irritable, restless, or discontent throughout your day to get those feelings out of your head and in your journal. It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>\u2022 Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.<br><br>There are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery.

    "descriptionHtml": "My OA Toolkit (OAT) is an exciting new OA App to help members of Overeaters Anonymous while on the go! <br><br>You can use My OA Toolkit&#39;s Food Journal as a your Plan of Eating Tool for the day or as a way to log your food throughout your day and turn your food over to your sponsor at the end of the day.<br><br>You can also use your OAT Food Journal if you become irritable, restless, or discontent throughout your day to get those feelings out of your head and in your journal. It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>\u2022 Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.<br><br>There are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA&#39;s Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.<br>Source:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html<br><br><br>\u2022 Gratitude List <br>If you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  <br><br>* Hardship Discounts Available <br><br>In 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:<br>1. Abstinence: The act of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.<br>2. Recovery: Removal of the need to engage in compulsive eating behaviors.<br><br>Spiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is achieved through working and living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step Program.<br><br> * Permission to use the OA name granted by Overeaters Anonymous, Inc.

It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>\u2022 Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat.

(See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery.

    "descriptionHtml": "My OA Toolkit (OAT) is an exciting new OA App to help members of Overeaters Anonymous while on the go! <br><br>You can use My OA Toolkit&#39;s Food Journal as a your Plan of Eating Tool for the day or as a way to log your food throughout your day and turn your food over to your sponsor at the end of the day.<br><br>You can also use your OAT Food Journal if you become irritable, restless, or discontent throughout your day to get those feelings out of your head and in your journal. It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>\u2022 Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.<br><br>There are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA&#39;s Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.<br>Source:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html<br><br><br>\u2022 Gratitude List <br>If you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  <br><br>* Hardship Discounts Available <br><br>In 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:<br>1. Abstinence: The act of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.<br>2. Recovery: Removal of the need to engage in compulsive eating behaviors.<br><br>Spiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is achieved through working and living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step Program.<br><br> * Permission to use the OA name granted by Overeaters Anonymous, Inc.

It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>\u2022 Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.<br><br>There are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA&#39;s Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.<br>Source:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html<br><br><br>\u2022 Gratitude List <br>If you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  <br><br>* Hardship Discounts Available <br><br>In 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:<br>1.

    "descriptionHtml": "My OA Toolkit (OAT) is an exciting new OA App to help members of Overeaters Anonymous while on the go! <br><br>You can use My OA Toolkit&#39;s Food Journal as a your Plan of Eating Tool for the day or as a way to log your food throughout your day and turn your food over to your sponsor at the end of the day.<br><br>You can also use your OAT Food Journal if you become irritable, restless, or discontent throughout your day to get those feelings out of your head and in your journal. It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>\u2022 Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.<br><br>There are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA&#39;s Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.<br>Source:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html<br><br><br>\u2022 Gratitude List <br>If you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  <br><br>* Hardship Discounts Available <br><br>In 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:<br>1. Abstinence: The act of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.<br>2. Recovery: Removal of the need to engage in compulsive eating behaviors.<br><br>Spiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is achieved through working and living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step Program.<br><br> * Permission to use the OA name granted by Overeaters Anonymous, Inc.

It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>\u2022 Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat.

(See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery.

    "descriptionHtml": "My OA Toolkit (OAT) is an exciting new OA App to help members of Overeaters Anonymous while on the go! <br><br>You can use My OA Toolkit&#39;s Food Journal as a your Plan of Eating Tool for the day or as a way to log your food throughout your day and turn your food over to your sponsor at the end of the day.<br><br>You can also use your OAT Food Journal if you become irritable, restless, or discontent throughout your day to get those feelings out of your head and in your journal. It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>\u2022 Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.<br><br>There are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA&#39;s Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.<br>Source:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html<br><br><br>\u2022 Gratitude List <br>If you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  <br><br>* Hardship Discounts Available <br><br>In 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:<br>1. Abstinence: The act of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.<br>2. Recovery: Removal of the need to engage in compulsive eating behaviors.<br><br>Spiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is achieved through working and living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step Program.<br><br> * Permission to use the OA name granted by Overeaters Anonymous, Inc.

    "descriptionHtml": "My OA Toolkit (OAT) is an exciting new OA App to help members of Overeaters Anonymous while on the go! <br><br>You can use My OA Toolkit&#39;s Food Journal as a your Plan of Eating Tool for the day or as a way to log your food throughout your day and turn your food over to your sponsor at the end of the day.<br><br>You can also use your OAT Food Journal if you become irritable, restless, or discontent throughout your day to get those feelings out of your head and in your journal. It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! <br><br>Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... <br><br>It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you&#39;ve abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.<br><br>FEATURES: <br><br>\u2022 Food Journal / Diary <br><br>In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.<br><br>You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.<br>As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.<br><br>There are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.<br><br>Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.<br><br>This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA&#39;s Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.<br>Source:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html<br><br><br>\u2022 Gratitude List <br>If you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  <br><br>* Hardship Discounts Available <br><br>In 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:<br>1. Abstinence: The act of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.<br>2. Recovery: Removal of the need to engage in compulsive eating behaviors.<br><br>Spiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is achieved through working and living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step Program.<br><br> * Permission to use the OA name granted by Overeaters Anonymous, Inc.

The app is free to use but you will need a code from one of the organisations we partner with to access the correct content and services.*<br><br>Thrive: Mental Wellbeing is an evidence-based app to prevent and manage stress, anxiety, and related conditions. Developed in the UK by specialists with many years of clinical experience, the app uses easy to learn clinically proven techniques to help you live a happier, more relaxed, stress-free life.<br><br>The app helps you monitor your mood and teaches you relaxation techniques such as meditation and deep muscle relaxation that with practice have shown to help people cope better with stressful situations. It also has a &#39;thought trainer&#39; programme based on cognitive behavioural therapy to help you manage those negative thoughts. With no rules to use the app, you are free to jump in for 3 minutes to relax before a stressful situation or use more regularly to improve resilience and keep stress under control.<br><br>How do we know it works?<br><br>We have thousands of users worldwide.

We have a research programme in partnership with the University of Roehampton focused on continuously improving engagement and efficacy.<br><br>Monitor your emotions<br><br>Using our Mood Meter you have a confidential platform to track your mood, the emotions you feel, and the situation you were in. We then help you to reframe this, thinking positively about a certain aspect of the situation and reminding you what you did on a specific day to make you feel good. By remembering what we can change rather than what we can not, we can help ourselves to control our emotional state and live happier lives!<br><br>Personalised messages, games, and more!<br><br>With our message in a bottle and wise words sessions, there are plenty of ways to interact and have fun with our app. Below are some more reasons why thousands of people are feeling the benefits of our app:<br><br>- On the go: Proven therapeutic techniques available in your hands whenever you want them.<br>- Easy to do: In your own time, at your own pace, with an interactive guide to help you along your journey!<br>- Efficient: Improve your well-being, whether already stressed or anxious or simply for prevention and resilience.<br>- Confidential: Away from stigma or judgement, and usually accessed in a quiet place, in your own time, completely anonymously!<br><br>Thrive is free for our users but it is provided alongside other services beyond the app itself. This means that your charity, insurer, company or other organisation you may belong to has to sign up in order for us to provide the service.

The app is free to use but you will need a code from one of the organisations we partner with to access the correct content and services.*<br><br>Thrive: Mental Wellbeing is an evidence-based app to prevent and manage stress, anxiety, and related conditions. Developed in the UK by specialists with many years of clinical experience, the app uses easy to learn clinically proven techniques to help you live a happier, more relaxed, stress-free life.<br><br>The app helps you monitor your mood and teaches you relaxation techniques such as meditation and deep muscle relaxation that with practice have shown to help people cope better with stressful situations. It also has a &#39;thought trainer&#39; programme based on cognitive behavioural therapy to help you manage those negative thoughts. With no rules to use the app, you are free to jump in for 3 minutes to relax before a stressful situation or use more regularly to improve resilience and keep stress under control.<br><br>How do we know it works?<br><br>We have thousands of users worldwide.

We have a research programme in partnership with the University of Roehampton focused on continuously improving engagement and efficacy.<br><br>Monitor your emotions<br><br>Using our Mood Meter you have a confidential platform to track your mood, the emotions you feel, and the situation you were in. We then help you to reframe this, thinking positively about a certain aspect of the situation and reminding you what you did on a specific day to make you feel good. By remembering what we can change rather than what we can not, we can help ourselves to control our emotional state and live happier lives!<br><br>Personalised messages, games, and more!<br><br>With our message in a bottle and wise words sessions, there are plenty of ways to interact and have fun with our app. Below are some more reasons why thousands of people are feeling the benefits of our app:<br><br>- On the go: Proven therapeutic techniques available in your hands whenever you want them.<br>- Easy to do: In your own time, at your own pace, with an interactive guide to help you along your journey!<br>- Efficient: Improve your well-being, whether already stressed or anxious or simply for prevention and resilience.<br>- Confidential: Away from stigma or judgement, and usually accessed in a quiet place, in your own time, completely anonymously!<br><br>Thrive is free for our users but it is provided alongside other services beyond the app itself.

The app is free to use but you will need a code from one of the organisations we partner with to access the correct content and services.*<br><br>Thrive: Mental Wellbeing is an evidence-based app to prevent and manage stress, anxiety, and related conditions. Developed in the UK by specialists with many years of clinical experience, the app uses easy to learn clinically proven techniques to help you live a happier, more relaxed, stress-free life.<br><br>The app helps you monitor your mood and teaches you relaxation techniques such as meditation and deep muscle relaxation that with practice have shown to help people cope better with stressful situations. It also has a &#39;thought trainer&#39; programme based on cognitive behavioural therapy to help you manage those negative thoughts. With no rules to use the app, you are free to jump in for 3 minutes to relax before a stressful situation or use more regularly to improve resilience and keep stress under control.<br><br>How do we know it works?<br><br>We have thousands of users worldwide. We are not trying to reinvent the wheel  - we use techniques that have been practised in hospitals and clinics for years, but in a fun, game-based format. We have a research programme in partnership with the University of Roehampton focused on continuously improving engagement and efficacy.<br><br>Monitor your emotions<br><br>Using our Mood Meter you have a confidential platform to track your mood, the emotions you feel, and the situation you were in. We then help you to reframe this, thinking positively about a certain aspect of the situation and reminding you what you did on a specific day to make you feel good. By remembering what we can change rather than what we can not, we can help ourselves to control our emotional state and live happier lives!<br><br>Personalised messages, games, and more!<br><br>With our message in a bottle and wise words sessions, there are plenty of ways to interact and have fun with our app. Below are some more reasons why thousands of people are feeling the benefits of our app:<br><br>- On the go: Proven therapeutic techniques available in your hands whenever you want them.<br>- Easy to do: In your own time, at your own pace, with an interactive guide to help you along your journey!<br>- Efficient: Improve your well-being, whether already stressed or anxious or simply for prevention and resilience.<br>- Confidential: Away from stigma or judgement, and usually accessed in a quiet place, in your own time, completely anonymously!<br><br>Thrive is free for our users but it is provided alongside other services beyond the app itself. This means that your charity, insurer, company or other organisation you may belong to has to sign up in order for us to provide the service.

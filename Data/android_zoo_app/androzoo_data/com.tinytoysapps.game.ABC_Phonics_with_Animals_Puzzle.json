    "descriptionHtml": "This ABC Phonics with Animals Puzzle game will help your kids, to develop their following skills <br><br>1.\tLearn English letter and their phonic sound<br>2.\tFine motor skills<br>3.\tPuzzle solving skill<br>4.\tDevelops their memory<br>5.\tVisual perception<br>6.\tLearn about Animals<br>7.\tAttention skill<br>8.\tLogical thinking skill<br>9.\tEntertainment and joy<br><br>This game contains more than 60 + animal puzzles and phonics for all the letters. This is a very enjoyable and fun educational game for Preschool children and toddlers, and this will also help develop children&#39;s skills with autism.<br><br> Why kids should learn phonics.<br><br>It is all about phonetic reading of English words. If a child learns phonics they don&#39;t have to memorize words to read it, they only need to know about its letter and phonics sound. (Phonics sounds only)<br>If a child knows phonic well they can try spelling any English word.<br>This is the first step, from this it will teach them English alphabet letter sound.<br>There are other ways to teach English reading, but if we use phonic for these children, they can read most of the words without memorizing them, and this is also a proven method of research.<br> <br> What are the benefits of fine motor skills?<br><br>Fine motor skills are the coordination between small muscles that control the hands, fingers and thumb through eyes. Fine motor skills involve the small muscles of the body that allow such functions as writing, combining small parts of the object with fingers. On this ABC Phonics with Animals Puzzle, they need to use their fingers to collect parts of animal puzzles and create animals that involve a lot of hand and eye manipulation.<br><br>It&#39;s better to start building their fine motor skills early. Fine motor skills develop and improve as they move through childhood. It&#39;s just going to take the right kind of practice.<br><br> Puzzle solving skill &amp; develops their memory<br><br>Simple Puzzle can help children learn how to manipulate objects by turning, placing and flipping pieces. This will increase memory problem solving skills.<br><br>The completion of a puzzle, even the simplest of puzzles, sets a single goal to be achieved. Toddlers and children must think and develop strategies on how to approach in achieving this goal. This process involves problem-solving, reasoning skills and developing solutions that can be later transferred to their personal / adult life.<br><br> Visual perception<br><br>Visual perception refers to the ability of the brain to make sense of what the eyes see. When working on puzzles, present one piece at a time and cover the unnecessary pieces of the puzzle. Kids need to figure out the overall shape of the animal, and then they need to combine all the parts to complete the animal. In this process, children&#39;s brains need to visually figure out the parts of each individual animal&#39;s puzzle.<br><br>Learn about Animals.<br><br>From this ABC Phonics with Animals Puzzle game, kids can learn about animals, their names and their living environment.<br><br>Attention skill and Logical thinking skill<br><br>Kids need to keep on attention when they solve animal puzzles, and also when they combine each part they need to have the ability to think logically.<br><br>Features<br>    1.\tContains more than 60 animal puzzles and their names<br>    2.\tPhonics sound of the letter of the alphabet. <br>    3.\tIntroduce all simple letters in English with their phonics<br>    4.\tWonderful and beautiful background that relates to the living environment of         every animal<br>    5.\tCute animal cartoon illustrations.<br>    6.\tSweet background music and sound.<br>    7.\tNice balloon popup when the kids have finished each puzzle.<br><br>The game is suitable for children under 5 years of age and this will be free with ads so children will not get annoyed during the game play.<br><br>Even for children with autism, these puzzles help them develop their memory, attention, logical thinking, fine hand motor skills and just entertain children.<br><br>This is a game with the best graphics so kids can enjoy it.

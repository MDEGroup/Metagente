    "descriptionHtml": "Think the credit system is stacked against you? So do we. Empower is on a mission to help more people access affordable credit, build their credit history, and rewrite their financial story. No credit score or security deposit to qualify.<br> <br>(Empower is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services provided by nbkc bank, Member FDIC. Empower Thrive provided by FinWise Bank, Member FDIC.)<br><br>GET CASH ADVANCE UP TO $250*<br>Tight on cash and tired of asking friends to cover you? Empower will float you anywhere from $25 to $250 when you need it most. Instant delivery available. No interest, no late fees, no credit checks. Just pay us back when you get your next paycheck.<br> <br>BUILD UP TO $1,000 OVER TIME WITH AN EMPOWER REVOLVING THRIVE LINE OF CREDIT^ (COMING SOON!)<br>Start with a $200 revolving line of credit and grow to $1,000 with every on-time payment. Enjoy instant delivery and 0% APR** (when you pay your balance on your next paycheck date, otherwise 36% APR). Building credit just got a whole lot easier.<br><br>GET YOUR PAYCHECK UP TO 2 DAYS FASTER\u2020<br>Wish payday came sooner? Wish no more. With the Empower Card, you can get paid up to 2 days earlier than most banks. <br> <br>GET UP TO 10% CASHBACK\u2020<br>Perks of a credit card but with a debit card. With the Empower Card, save money on the places where you shop already, like restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, and more. No overdraft fees.<br><br>GET FREE ATM WITHDRAWALS<br>Enjoy convenient access with the Empower Card to over 37,000 MoneyPass ATMs across the US. Use them as often as you want, whenever you want, and never get charged a single dime for taking out cash.<br><br>GET FAST SERVICE<br>We\u2019ve got our A team on standby to handle your questions over the phone or live chat Monday-Friday from 6 AM \u2013 6 PM PT. (We\u2019ve got email too if that\u2019s more your jam.)<br><br>TRACK YOUR SPEND<br>Take control of your finances by monitoring your spend against weekly or monthly category limits. We\u2019ll send you 24/7 alerts to help you do better.<br><br>\u2013<br><br>Empower charges an auto-recurring monthly subscription fee of $8 (a) after the 14-day free trial concludes for first-time customers, and (b) immediately for customers returning for a second or subsequent subscription. Cancel anytime. <br> <br>* Eligibility requirements apply. Free instant delivery is available for eligible customers with an activated Empower Card.<br> <br>^ Eligibility requirements apply. Opening an Empower Thrive line of credit restricts access to Empower Cash Advance, with access restricted until the Empower Thrive line of credit is closed and you meet the eligibility requirements for Empower Cash Advance. Instant delivery is available for a 5% fee of the draw amount on the line of credit. We report your payments to the credit bureaus. Pay on time and keep utilization low for the best potential benefit. Many factors impact your credit score, and while making on-time payments and keeping utilization low may improve your score, there is no guarantee this will improve your score.<br> <br>** The Annual Percentage Rate is subject to change. An Empower Thrive line of credit is subject to credit approval. There are no costs to open an Empower Thrive line of credit. If you choose to pay your draw in full on your next paycheck date, your rate will be 0% APR; if you miss your payment, you will accrue interest at 36% APR and may incur late fees. If you choose to pay your draw on a date other than your next paycheck date, your rate will be 36% APR or as otherwise required by state law.<br> <br>\u2020 Early access to paycheck deposit funds depends on the timing of the employer&#39;s submission of deposits. We generally post such deposits on the day they are received which may be up to 2 days earlier than the employer&#39;s scheduled payment date. Cashback deals on Empower Card purchases, including categories, merchants, and percentages, will vary and must be selected in the app. Cashback will be applied automatically when the final transaction posts, which may be up to a week after the qualifying purchase.",

Empower is on a mission to help more people access affordable credit, build their credit history, and rewrite their financial story. No credit score or security deposit to qualify.<br> <br>(Empower is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services provided by nbkc bank, Member FDIC. Empower Thrive provided by FinWise Bank, Member FDIC.)<br><br>GET CASH ADVANCE UP TO $250*<br>Tight on cash and tired of asking friends to cover you? Empower will float you anywhere from $25 to $250 when you need it most. Instant delivery available. No interest, no late fees, no credit checks. Just pay us back when you get your next paycheck.<br> <br>BUILD UP TO $1,000 OVER TIME WITH AN EMPOWER THRIVE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT^ (COMING SOON!)<br>Start with a $200 revolving line of credit and grow to $1,000 with every on-time payment. Enjoy instant delivery and 0% APR** (when you pay your balance on your next paycheck date, otherwise 35.99% APR). Building credit just got a whole lot easier.<br> <br>Empower Thrive is a revolving product (meaning you can draw up to your limit while your account remains in good standing). Each draw has an APR between 0-35.99%. The minimum term for repayment is 81 days. The maximum term for repayment is 112 days.<br> <br>Examples of total cost: (exact amounts vary based on the time of draw and repayment date)<br> <br>If you draw $100 via next day ACH and opt to pay on your next paydate then the repayment is $100 (0% APR; no fees or interest).<br> <br>If you draw $100 via Instant Payout and opt to repay on your next paydate then the repayment is $105 (0% APR; $100 principal and $5 instant fee).<br> <br>If you draw $100 via next day ACH and opt to pay in two calendar months then your repayment would be $106 (35.99% APR, $100 principal and $6 interest).<br> <br>You can redraw immediately upon successful repayment.<br><br>GET YOUR PAYCHECK UP TO 2 DAYS FASTER\u2020<br>Wish payday came sooner? Wish no more. With the Empower Card, you can get paid up to 2 days earlier than most banks. <br> <br>GET UP TO 10% CASHBACK\u2020<br>Perks of a credit card but with a debit card. With the Empower Card, save money on the places where you shop already, like restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, and more. No overdraft fees.<br><br>\u2013<br><br>Empower charges an auto-recurring monthly subscription fee of $8 (a) after the 14-day free trial concludes for first-time customers, and (b) immediately for customers returning for a second or subsequent subscription. Cancel anytime. <br> <br>* Eligibility requirements apply. Free instant delivery is available for eligible customers with an activated Empower Card.<br> <br>^ Eligibility requirements apply. Opening an Empower Thrive line of credit restricts access to Empower Cash Advance, with access restricted until the Empower Thrive line of credit is closed and you meet the eligibility requirements for Empower Cash Advance. Instant delivery is available for a 5% fee of the draw amount on the line of credit. We report your payments to the credit bureaus. Pay on time and keep utilization low for the best potential benefit. Many factors impact your credit score, and while making on-time payments and keeping utilization low may improve your score, there is no guarantee this will improve your score.<br> <br>** The Annual Percentage Rate is subject to change. An Empower Thrive line of credit is subject to credit approval. There are no costs to open an Empower Thrive line of credit. If you choose to pay your draw in full on your next paycheck date, your rate will be 0% APR; if you miss your payment, you will accrue interest at 35.99% APR and may incur late fees. If you choose to pay your draw on a date other than your next paycheck date, your rate will be 35.99% APR or as otherwise required by state law.<br> <br>\u2020 Early access to paycheck deposit funds may vary by employer. Cashback deals on Empower Card purchases will vary and must be selected in the app.",

Empower is on a mission to help more people access affordable credit, build their credit history, and rewrite their financial story. No credit score or security deposit to qualify.<br> <br>(Empower is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services provided by nbkc bank, Member FDIC. Empower Thrive provided by FinWise Bank, Member FDIC.)<br><br>GET CASH ADVANCE UP TO $250*<br>Tight on cash and tired of asking friends to cover you? Empower will float you anywhere from $25 to $250 when you need it most. Instant delivery available. No interest, no late fees, no credit checks. Just pay us back when you get your next paycheck.<br> <br>BUILD UP TO $1,000 OVER TIME WITH AN EMPOWER THRIVE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT^ (COMING SOON!)<br>Start with a $200 revolving line of credit and grow to $1,000 with every on-time payment. Enjoy instant delivery and 0% APR** (when you pay your balance on your next paycheck date, otherwise 35.99% APR). Building credit just got a whole lot easier.<br><br>GET YOUR PAYCHECK UP TO 2 DAYS FASTER\u2020<br>Wish payday came sooner? Wish no more. With the Empower Card, you can get paid up to 2 days earlier than most banks. <br> <br>GET UP TO 10% CASHBACK\u2020<br>Perks of a credit card but with a debit card. With the Empower Card, save money on the places where you shop already, like restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, and more. No overdraft fees.<br><br>\u2013<br><br>Empower charges an auto-recurring monthly subscription fee of $8 (a) after the 14-day free trial concludes for first-time customers, and (b) immediately for customers returning for a second or subsequent subscription. Cancel anytime. <br> <br>* Eligibility requirements apply. Free instant delivery is available for eligible customers with an activated Empower Card.<br> <br>^ Eligibility requirements apply. Opening an Empower Thrive line of credit restricts access to Empower Cash Advance, with access restricted until the Empower Thrive line of credit is closed and you meet the eligibility requirements for Empower Cash Advance. Instant delivery is available for a 5% fee of the draw amount on the line of credit. We report your payments to the credit bureaus. Pay on time and keep utilization low for the best potential benefit. Many factors impact your credit score, and while making on-time payments and keeping utilization low may improve your score, there is no guarantee this will improve your score.<br> <br>** The Annual Percentage Rate is subject to change. An Empower Thrive line of credit is subject to credit approval. There are no costs to open an Empower Thrive line of credit. If you choose to pay your draw in full on your next paycheck date, your rate will be 0% APR; if you miss your payment, you will accrue interest at 35.99% APR and may incur late fees. If you choose to pay your draw on a date other than your next paycheck date, your rate will be 35.99% APR or as otherwise required by state law.<br> <br>\u2020 Early access to paycheck deposit funds may vary by employer. Cashback deals on Empower Card purchases will vary and must be selected in the app.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Think the credit system is stacked against you? So do we. Empower is on a mission to help more people access affordable credit, build their credit history, and rewrite their financial story. No credit score or security deposit to qualify.<br> <br>(Empower is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services provided by nbkc bank, Member FDIC. Empower Thrive provided by FinWise Bank, Member FDIC.)<br><br>GET CASH ADVANCE UP TO $250*<br>Tight on cash and tired of asking friends to cover you? Empower will float you anywhere from $25 to $250 when you need it most. Instant delivery available. No interest, no late fees, no credit checks. Just pay us back when you get your next paycheck.<br> <br>BUILD UP TO $1,000 OVER TIME WITH AN EMPOWER THRIVE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT^ (COMING SOON!)<br>Start with a $200 revolving line of credit and grow to $1,000 with every on-time payment. Enjoy instant delivery and 0% APR** (when you pay your balance on your next paycheck date, otherwise 35.99% APR). Building credit just got a whole lot easier.<br><br>GET YOUR PAYCHECK UP TO 2 DAYS FASTER\u2020<br>Wish payday came sooner? Wish no more. With the Empower Card, you can get paid up to 2 days earlier than most banks. <br> <br>GET UP TO 10% CASHBACK\u2020<br>Perks of a credit card but with a debit card. With the Empower Card, save money on the places where you shop already, like restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, and more. No overdraft fees.<br><br>\u2013<br><br>Empower charges an auto-recurring monthly subscription fee of $8 (a) after the 14-day free trial concludes for first-time customers, and (b) immediately for customers returning for a second or subsequent subscription. Cancel anytime. <br> <br>* Eligibility requirements apply. Free instant delivery is available for eligible customers with an activated Empower Card.<br> <br>^ Eligibility requirements apply. Opening an Empower Thrive line of credit restricts access to Empower Cash Advance, with access restricted until the Empower Thrive line of credit is closed and you meet the eligibility requirements for Empower Cash Advance. Instant delivery is available for a 5% fee of the draw amount on the line of credit. We report your payments to the credit bureaus. Pay on time and keep utilization low for the best potential benefit. Many factors impact your credit score, and while making on-time payments and keeping utilization low may improve your score, there is no guarantee this will improve your score.<br> <br>** The Annual Percentage Rate is subject to change. An Empower Thrive line of credit is subject to credit approval. There are no costs to open an Empower Thrive line of credit. If you choose to pay your draw in full on your next paycheck date, your rate will be 0% APR; if you miss your payment, you will accrue interest at 35.99% APR and may incur late fees. If you choose to pay your draw on a date other than your next paycheck date, your rate will be 35.99% APR or as otherwise required by state law.<br> <br>\u2020 Early access to paycheck deposit funds may vary by employer. Cashback deals on Empower Card purchases will vary and must be selected in the app.",

Empower is on a mission to help more people access affordable credit, build their credit history, and rewrite their financial story. No credit score or security deposit to qualify.<br> <br>(Empower is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services provided by nbkc bank, Member FDIC. Empower Thrive provided by FinWise Bank, Member FDIC.)<br><br>GET CASH ADVANCE UP TO $250*<br>Tight on cash and tired of asking friends to cover you? Empower will float you anywhere from $25 to $250 when you need it most. Instant delivery available. No interest, no late fees, no credit checks. Just pay us back when you get your next paycheck.<br> <br>BUILD UP TO $1,000 OVER TIME WITH AN EMPOWER THRIVE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT^ (COMING SOON!)<br>Start with a $200 revolving line of credit and grow to $1,000 with every on-time payment. Enjoy instant delivery and 0% APR** (when you pay your balance on your next paycheck date, otherwise 35.99% APR). Building credit just got a whole lot easier.<br><br>GET YOUR PAYCHECK UP TO 2 DAYS FASTER\u2020<br>Wish payday came sooner? Wish no more. With the Empower Card, you can get paid up to 2 days earlier than most banks. <br> <br>GET UP TO 10% CASHBACK\u2020<br>Perks of a credit card but with a debit card. With the Empower Card, save money on the places where you shop already, like restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, and more. No overdraft fees.<br><br>\u2013<br><br>Empower charges an auto-recurring monthly subscription fee of $8 (a) after the 14-day free trial concludes for first-time customers, and (b) immediately for customers returning for a second or subsequent subscription. Cancel anytime. <br> <br>* Eligibility requirements apply. Free instant delivery is available for eligible customers with an activated Empower Card.<br> <br>^ Eligibility requirements apply. Opening an Empower Thrive line of credit restricts access to Empower Cash Advance, with access restricted until the Empower Thrive line of credit is closed and you meet the eligibility requirements for Empower Cash Advance. Instant delivery is available for a 5% fee of the draw amount on the line of credit. We report your payments to the credit bureaus. Pay on time and keep utilization low for the best potential benefit. Many factors impact your credit score, and while making on-time payments and keeping utilization low may improve your score, there is no guarantee this will improve your score.<br> <br>** The Annual Percentage Rate is subject to change. An Empower Thrive line of credit is subject to credit approval. There are no costs to open an Empower Thrive line of credit. If you choose to pay your draw in full on your next paycheck date, your rate will be 0% APR; if you miss your payment, you will accrue interest at 35.99% APR and may incur late fees. If you choose to pay your draw on a date other than your next paycheck date, your rate will be 35.99% APR or as otherwise required by state law.<br> <br>\u2020 Early access to paycheck deposit funds may vary by employer. Cashback deals on Empower Card purchases will vary and must be selected in the app.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Think the credit system is stacked against you? So do we. Empower is on a mission to help more people access affordable credit, build their credit history, and rewrite their financial story. No credit score or security deposit to qualify.<br> <br>(Empower is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services provided by nbkc bank, Member FDIC. Empower Thrive provided by FinWise Bank, Member FDIC.)<br><br>GET CASH ADVANCE UP TO $250*<br>Tight on cash and tired of asking friends to cover you? Empower will float you anywhere from $25 to $250 when you need it most. Instant delivery available. No interest, no late fees, no credit checks. Just pay us back when you get your next paycheck.<br> <br>BUILD UP TO $1,000 OVER TIME WITH AN EMPOWER THRIVE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT^ (COMING SOON!)<br>Start with a $200 revolving line of credit and grow to $1,000 with every on-time payment. Enjoy instant delivery and 0% APR** (when you pay your balance on your next paycheck date, otherwise 35.99% APR). Building credit just got a whole lot easier.<br><br>GET YOUR PAYCHECK UP TO 2 DAYS FASTER\u2020<br>Wish payday came sooner? Wish no more. With the Empower Card, you can get paid up to 2 days earlier than most banks. <br> <br>GET UP TO 10% CASHBACK\u2020<br>Perks of a credit card but with a debit card. With the Empower Card, save money on the places where you shop already, like restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, and more. No overdraft fees.<br><br>\u2013<br><br>Empower charges an auto-recurring monthly subscription fee of $8 (a) after the 14-day free trial concludes for first-time customers, and (b) immediately for customers returning for a second or subsequent subscription. Cancel anytime. <br> <br>* Eligibility requirements apply. Free instant delivery is available for eligible customers with an activated Empower Card.<br> <br>^ Eligibility requirements apply. Opening an Empower Thrive line of credit restricts access to Empower Cash Advance, with access restricted until the Empower Thrive line of credit is closed and you meet the eligibility requirements for Empower Cash Advance. Instant delivery is available for a 5% fee of the draw amount on the line of credit. We report your payments to the credit bureaus. Pay on time and keep utilization low for the best potential benefit. Many factors impact your credit score, and while making on-time payments and keeping utilization low may improve your score, there is no guarantee this will improve your score.<br> <br>** The Annual Percentage Rate is subject to change. An Empower Thrive line of credit is subject to credit approval. There are no costs to open an Empower Thrive line of credit. If you choose to pay your draw in full on your next paycheck date, your rate will be 0% APR; if you miss your payment, you will accrue interest at 35.99% APR and may incur late fees. If you choose to pay your draw on a date other than your next paycheck date, your rate will be 35.99% APR or as otherwise required by state law.<br> <br>\u2020 Early access to paycheck deposit funds may vary by employer. Cashback deals on Empower Card purchases will vary and must be selected in the app.",

An Empower Thrive line of credit is subject to credit approval. There are no costs to open an Empower Thrive line of credit. If you choose to pay your draw in full on your next paycheck date, your rate will be 0% APR; if you miss your payment, you will accrue interest at 35.99% APR and may incur late fees.

Empower will float you anywhere from $25 to $250 when you need it most. Instant delivery available. No interest, no late fees, no credit checks.

With the Empower Card, save money on the places where you shop already, like restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, and more. No overdraft fees.<br><br>\u2013<br><br>Empower charges an auto-recurring monthly subscription fee of $8 (a) after the 14-day free trial concludes for first-time customers, and (b) immediately for customers returning for a second or subsequent subscription. Cancel anytime. <br> <br>* Eligibility requirements apply. Free instant delivery is available for eligible customers with an activated Empower Card.<br> <br>^ Eligibility requirements apply. Opening an Empower Thrive line of credit restricts access to Empower Cash Advance, with access restricted until the Empower Thrive line of credit is closed and you meet the eligibility requirements for Empower Cash Advance. Instant delivery is available for a 5% fee of the draw amount on the line of credit. We report your payments to the credit bureaus. Pay on time and keep utilization low for the best potential benefit. Many factors impact your credit score, and while making on-time payments and keeping utilization low may improve your score, there is no guarantee this will improve your score.<br> <br>** The Annual Percentage Rate is subject to change. An Empower Thrive line of credit is subject to credit approval. There are no costs to open an Empower Thrive line of credit. If you choose to pay your draw in full on your next paycheck date, your rate will be 0% APR; if you miss your payment, you will accrue interest at 35.99% APR and may incur late fees. If you choose to pay your draw on a date other than your next paycheck date, your rate will be 35.99% APR or as otherwise required by state law.<br> <br>\u2020 Early access to paycheck deposit funds may vary by employer.

    "descriptionHtml": "Think the credit system is stacked against you? So do we. Empower is on a mission to help more people access affordable credit, build their credit history, and rewrite their financial story. No credit score or security deposit to qualify.<br> <br>(Empower is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services provided by nbkc bank, Member FDIC. Empower Thrive provided by FinWise Bank, Member FDIC.)<br><br>GET CASH ADVANCE UP TO $250*<br>Tight on cash and tired of asking friends to cover you? Empower will float you up to $250 when you need it most. Instant delivery available. No interest, no late fees, no credit checks. Just pay us back when you get your next paycheck.<br> <br>BUILD UP TO $1,000 OVER TIME WITH AN EMPOWER THRIVE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT^ (COMING SOON!)<br>Start with a $200 revolving line of credit and grow to $1,000 with every on-time payment. Enjoy instant delivery and 0% APR** (when you pay your balance on your next paycheck date, otherwise 35.99% APR). Building credit just got a whole lot easier.<br><br>GET YOUR PAYCHECK UP TO 2 DAYS FASTER\u2020<br>Wish payday came sooner? Wish no more. With the Empower Card, you can get paid up to 2 days earlier than most banks. <br> <br>GET UP TO 10% CASHBACK\u2020<br>Perks of a credit card but with a debit card. With the Empower Card, save money on the places where you shop already, like restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, and more. No overdraft fees.<br><br>\u2013<br><br>Empower charges an auto-recurring monthly subscription fee of $8 (a) after the 14-day free trial concludes for first-time customers, and (b) immediately for customers returning for a second or subsequent subscription. Cancel anytime. <br> <br>* Eligibility requirements apply. Free instant delivery is available for eligible customers with an activated Empower Card.<br> <br>^ Eligibility requirements apply. Opening an Empower Thrive line of credit restricts access to Empower Cash Advance, with access restricted until the Empower Thrive line of credit is closed and you meet the eligibility requirements for Empower Cash Advance. Instant delivery is available for a 5% fee of the draw amount on the line of credit. We report your payments to the credit bureaus. Pay on time and keep utilization low for the best potential benefit. Many factors impact your credit score, and while making on-time payments and keeping utilization low may improve your score, there is no guarantee this will improve your score.<br> <br>** The Annual Percentage Rate is subject to change. An Empower Thrive line of credit is subject to credit approval. There are no costs to open an Empower Thrive line of credit. If you choose to pay your draw in full on your next paycheck date, your rate will be 0% APR; if you miss your payment, you will accrue interest at 35.99% APR and may incur late fees. If you choose to pay your draw on a date other than your next paycheck date, your rate will be 35.99% APR or as otherwise required by state law.<br> <br>\u2020 Early access to paycheck deposit funds may vary by employer. Cashback deals on Empower Card purchases will vary and must be selected in the app.",

An Empower Thrive line of credit is subject to credit approval. There are no costs to open an Empower Thrive line of credit. If you choose to pay your draw in full on your next paycheck date, your rate will be 0% APR; if you miss your payment, you will accrue interest at 35.99% APR and may incur late fees. If you choose to pay your draw on a date other than your next paycheck date, your rate will be 35.99% APR or as otherwise required by state law.<br> <br>\u2020 Early access to paycheck deposit funds may vary by employer.

    "descriptionHtml": "Think the credit system is stacked against you? So do we. Empower is on a mission to help more people access affordable credit, build their credit history, and rewrite their financial story. No credit score or security deposit to qualify.<br> <br>(Empower is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services provided by nbkc bank, Member FDIC. Empower Thrive provided by FinWise Bank, Member FDIC.)<br><br>GET CASH ADVANCE UP TO $250*<br>Tight on cash and tired of asking friends to cover you? Empower will float you up to $250 when you need it most. Instant delivery available. No interest, no late fees, no credit checks. Just pay us back when you get your next paycheck.<br> <br>BUILD UP TO $1,000 OVER TIME WITH AN EMPOWER THRIVE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT^ (COMING SOON!)<br>Start with a $200 revolving line of credit and grow to $1,000 with every on-time payment. Enjoy instant delivery and 0% APR** (when you pay your balance on your next paycheck date, otherwise 35.99% APR). Building credit just got a whole lot easier.<br><br>GET YOUR PAYCHECK UP TO 2 DAYS FASTER\u2020<br>Wish payday came sooner? Wish no more. With the Empower Card, you can get paid up to 2 days earlier than most banks. <br> <br>GET UP TO 10% CASHBACK\u2020<br>Perks of a credit card but with a debit card. With the Empower Card, save money on the places where you shop already, like restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, and more. No overdraft fees.<br><br>\u2013<br><br>Empower charges an auto-recurring monthly subscription fee of $8 (a) after the 14-day free trial concludes for first-time customers, and (b) immediately for customers returning for a second or subsequent subscription. Cancel anytime. <br> <br>* Eligibility requirements apply. Free instant delivery is available for eligible customers with an activated Empower Card.<br> <br>^ Eligibility requirements apply. Opening an Empower Thrive line of credit restricts access to Empower Cash Advance, with access restricted until the Empower Thrive line of credit is closed and you meet the eligibility requirements for Empower Cash Advance. Instant delivery is available for a 5% fee of the draw amount on the line of credit. We report your payments to the credit bureaus. Pay on time and keep utilization low for the best potential benefit. Many factors impact your credit score, and while making on-time payments and keeping utilization low may improve your score, there is no guarantee this will improve your score.<br> <br>** The Annual Percentage Rate is subject to change. An Empower Thrive line of credit is subject to credit approval. There are no costs to open an Empower Thrive line of credit. If you choose to pay your draw in full on your next paycheck date, your rate will be 0% APR; if you miss your payment, you will accrue interest at 35.99% APR and may incur late fees. If you choose to pay your draw on a date other than your next paycheck date, your rate will be 35.99% APR or as otherwise required by state law.<br> <br>\u2020 Early access to paycheck deposit funds may vary by employer. Cashback deals on Empower Card purchases will vary and must be selected in the app.",

Pay on time and keep utilization low for the best potential benefit. Many factors impact your credit score, and while making on-time payments and keeping utilization low may improve your score, there is no guarantee this will improve your score.<br> <br>** The Annual Percentage Rate is subject to change. An Empower Thrive line of credit is subject to credit approval. There are no costs to open an Empower Thrive line of credit. If you choose to pay your draw in full on your next paycheck date, your rate will be 0% APR; if you miss your payment, you will accrue interest at 35.99% APR and may incur late fees. If you choose to pay your draw on a date other than your next paycheck date, your rate will be 35.99% APR or as otherwise required by state law.<br> <br>\u2020 Early access to paycheck deposit funds may vary by employer.

    "descriptionHtml": "Think the credit system is stacked against you? So do we. Empower is on a mission to help more people access affordable credit, build their credit history, and rewrite their financial story. No credit score or security deposit to qualify.<br> <br>(Empower is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services provided by nbkc bank, Member FDIC. Empower Thrive provided by FinWise Bank, Member FDIC.)<br><br>GET CASH ADVANCE UP TO $250*<br>Tight on cash and tired of asking friends to cover you? Empower will float you up to $250 when you need it most. Instant delivery available. No interest, no late fees, no credit checks. Just pay us back when you get your next paycheck.<br> <br>BUILD UP TO $1,000 OVER TIME WITH AN EMPOWER THRIVE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT^ (COMING SOON!)<br>Start with a $200 revolving line of credit and grow to $1,000 with every on-time payment. Enjoy instant delivery and 0% APR** (when you pay your balance on your next paycheck date, otherwise 35.99% APR). Building credit just got a whole lot easier.<br><br>GET YOUR PAYCHECK UP TO 2 DAYS FASTER\u2020<br>Wish payday came sooner? Wish no more. With the Empower Card, you can get paid up to 2 days earlier than most banks. <br> <br>GET UP TO 10% CASHBACK\u2020<br>Perks of a credit card but with a debit card. With the Empower Card, save money on the places where you shop already, like restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, and more. No overdraft fees.<br><br>\u2013<br><br>Empower charges an auto-recurring monthly subscription fee of $8 (a) after the 14-day free trial concludes for first-time customers, and (b) immediately for customers returning for a second or subsequent subscription. Cancel anytime. <br> <br>* Eligibility requirements apply. Free instant delivery is available for eligible customers with an activated Empower Card.<br> <br>^ Eligibility requirements apply. Opening an Empower Thrive line of credit restricts access to Empower Cash Advance, with access restricted until the Empower Thrive line of credit is closed and you meet the eligibility requirements for Empower Cash Advance. Instant delivery is available for a 5% fee of the draw amount on the line of credit. We report your payments to the credit bureaus. Pay on time and keep utilization low for the best potential benefit. Many factors impact your credit score, and while making on-time payments and keeping utilization low may improve your score, there is no guarantee this will improve your score.<br> <br>** The Annual Percentage Rate is subject to change. An Empower Thrive line of credit is subject to credit approval. There are no costs to open an Empower Thrive line of credit. If you choose to pay your draw in full on your next paycheck date, your rate will be 0% APR; if you miss your payment, you will accrue interest at 35.99% APR and may incur late fees. If you choose to pay your draw on a date other than your next paycheck date, your rate will be 35.99% APR or as otherwise required by state law.<br> <br>\u2020 Early access to paycheck deposit funds may vary by employer. Cashback deals on Empower Card purchases will vary and must be selected in the app.",

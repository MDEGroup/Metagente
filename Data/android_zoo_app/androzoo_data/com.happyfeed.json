    "descriptionHtml": "Happyfeed is a daily gratitude journal app that helps you focus on the bright side by reflecting on positive moments or gratitudes each day. Create a journal, or &quot;happy feed,&quot; of positive memories you&#39;ll love to explore while training your brain to express gratitude, feel more grateful in life, and become more resilient. <br><br>\u2022 Add photos and locations (optionally) to your posts<br>\u2022 Daily happy memories from your journal weeks to years ago<br>\u2022 Join a Pod to share progress and select moments in small groups<br>\u2022 Custom prompts - reminders, quotes, and fun facts each day<br>\u2022 Tag your best days with an emoji<br>\u2022 Free, unlimited posting forever<br>\u2022 Fully private: only optional sharing with Pods<br><br>*Explore Your Happy Memories<br>After your first week, you\u2019ll be able to hop back to memories from your gratitude journal exactly a week ago. This period grows from weeks to years and becomes another source of happiness throughout your day.<br><br>*Pods: Journaling Together<br>Pods are small, private groups where you can share your journaling progress and favorite moments. It&#39;s a place to connect with your friends, your partner, your family, or anyone. Imagine a feed of only personalized, happy moments - that&#39;s Pods!<br><br>*Unique Reminders Daily<br>Every day our team writes a custom daily reminder to help you remember to enter your moments. This could be a quote about happiness, a fact about this day in history, or just a fun little joke to try and brighten up your day.<br><br>*Happiness Jar<br>After your second week of recording moments on Happyfeed, you&#39;ll be able to use the Happiness Jar to view a random past day and all your positive memories. It&#39;s a fun way to boost your mood and feel a little more thankful every day. <br><br>*Benefits of Gratitude Journaling<br>Keeping a gratitude journal is an effective practice in helping to reduce stress and anxiety while improving your overall happiness. It&#39;s as simple as writing down 3 good things each day (or night). Especially in tough times, the practice of actively reflecting on what you are thankful for can help you refocus your thoughts on the positive. Recording what you are grateful is a proven self-care technique with proven benefits by positive psychology.<br><br>*Sync On All Your Devices<br>We also offer a web version where you can upload and view your past moments - just check out our website after signing up. Your moments and photos are privately synced to your account so you\u2019ll never lose them. Just another reason to be thankful!<br><br>*Private &amp; Secure<br>Your moments are only visible to you and never posted publicly. All cloud syncing is securely encrypted using HTTPS endpoints. <br><br>*Your Account<br>An account is required in order to keep your moments safe and to allow you to view and manage them across multiple devices. If you lose your device, you won\u2019t lose all your happy memories. You may choose to share your location to provide you with meaningful data on the places, people, and things that help you find happiness.<br><br>*About Us<br>We designed Happyfeed to be a simple way to be grateful each day and build a happy feed of all the best moments in your life. Each feature in Happyfeed is intended to follow best-practices from positive psychology research - so your time is well spent. It&#39;s a simple habit that can make a real, positive change on your mood and become a more mindful person :)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Happyfeed is a daily gratitude journal app that helps you focus on the bright side by reflecting on positive moments or gratitudes each day. Create a journal, or &quot;happy feed,&quot; of positive memories you&#39;ll love to explore while training your brain to express gratitude, feel more grateful in life, and become more resilient. <br><br>\u2022 Add photos and locations (optionally) to your posts<br>\u2022 Daily happy memories from your journal weeks to years ago<br>\u2022 Join a Pod to share progress and select moments in small groups<br>\u2022 Custom prompts - reminders, quotes, and fun facts each day<br>\u2022 Tag your best days with an emoji<br>\u2022 Free, unlimited posting forever<br>\u2022 Fully private: only optional sharing with Pods<br><br>*Explore Your Happy Memories<br>After your first week, you\u2019ll be able to hop back to memories from your gratitude journal exactly a week ago. This period grows from weeks to years and becomes another source of happiness throughout your day.<br><br>*Pods: Journaling Together<br>Pods are small, private groups where you can share your journaling progress and favorite moments. It&#39;s a place to connect with your friends, your partner, your family, or anyone. Imagine a feed of only personalized, happy moments - that&#39;s Pods!<br><br>*Unique Reminders Daily<br>Every day our team writes a custom daily reminder to help you remember to enter your moments. This could be a quote about happiness, a fact about this day in history, or just a fun little joke to try and brighten up your day.<br><br>*Happiness Jar<br>After your second week of recording moments on Happyfeed, you&#39;ll be able to use the Happiness Jar to view a random past day and all your positive memories. It&#39;s a fun way to boost your mood and feel a little more thankful every day. <br><br>*Benefits of Gratitude Journaling<br>Keeping a gratitude journal is an effective practice in helping to reduce stress and anxiety while improving your overall happiness. It&#39;s as simple as writing down 3 good things each day (or night). Especially in tough times, the practice of actively reflecting on what you are thankful for can help you refocus your thoughts on the positive. Recording what you are grateful is a proven self-care technique with proven benefits by positive psychology.<br><br>*Sync On All Your Devices<br>We also offer a web version where you can upload and view your past moments - just check out our website after signing up. Your moments and photos are privately synced to your account so you\u2019ll never lose them. Just another reason to be thankful!<br><br>*Private &amp; Secure<br>Your moments are only visible to you and never posted publicly. All cloud syncing is securely encrypted using HTTPS endpoints. <br><br>*Your Account<br>An account is required in order to keep your moments safe and to allow you to view and manage them across multiple devices. If you lose your device, you won\u2019t lose all your happy memories. You may choose to share your location to provide you with meaningful data on the places, people, and things that help you find happiness.<br><br>*About Us<br>We designed Happyfeed to be a simple way to be grateful each day and build a happy feed of all the best moments in your life. Each feature in Happyfeed is intended to follow best-practices from positive psychology research - so your time is well spent. It&#39;s a simple habit that can make a real, positive change on your mood and become a more mindful person :)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Happyfeed is a daily gratitude journal app that helps you focus on the bright side by reflecting on positive moments or gratitudes each day. Create a journal, or &quot;happy feed,&quot; of positive memories you&#39;ll love to explore while training your brain to express gratitude, feel more grateful in life, and become more resilient. <br><br>\u2022 Add photos and locations (optionally) to your posts<br>\u2022 Daily happy memories from your journal weeks to years ago<br>\u2022 Join a Pod to share progress and select moments in small groups<br>\u2022 Custom prompts - reminders, quotes, and fun facts each day<br>\u2022 Tag your best days with an emoji<br>\u2022 Free, unlimited posting forever<br>\u2022 Fully private: only optional sharing with Pods<br><br>*Explore Your Happy Memories<br>After your first week, you\u2019ll be able to hop back to memories from your gratitude journal exactly a week ago. This period grows from weeks to years and becomes another source of happiness throughout your day.<br><br>*Pods: Journaling Together<br>Pods are small, private groups where you can share your journaling progress and favorite moments. It&#39;s a place to connect with your friends, your partner, your family, or anyone. Imagine a feed of only personalized, happy moments - that&#39;s Pods!<br><br>*Unique Reminders Daily<br>Every day our team writes a custom daily reminder to help you remember to enter your moments. This could be a quote about happiness, a fact about this day in history, or just a fun little joke to try and brighten up your day.<br><br>*Happiness Jar<br>After your second week of recording moments on Happyfeed, you&#39;ll be able to use the Happiness Jar to view a random past day and all your positive memories. It&#39;s a fun way to boost your mood and feel a little more thankful every day. <br><br>*Benefits of Gratitude Journaling<br>Keeping a gratitude journal is an effective practice in helping to reduce stress and anxiety while improving your overall happiness. It&#39;s as simple as writing down 3 good things each day (or night). Especially in tough times, the practice of actively reflecting on what you are thankful for can help you refocus your thoughts on the positive. Recording what you are grateful is a proven self-care technique with proven benefits by positive psychology.<br><br>*Sync On All Your Devices<br>We also offer a web version where you can upload and view your past moments - just check out our website after signing up. Your moments and photos are privately synced to your account so you\u2019ll never lose them. Just another reason to be thankful!<br><br>*Private &amp; Secure<br>Your moments are only visible to you and never posted publicly. All cloud syncing is securely encrypted using HTTPS endpoints. <br><br>*Your Account<br>An account is required in order to keep your moments safe and to allow you to view and manage them across multiple devices. If you lose your device, you won\u2019t lose all your happy memories. You may choose to share your location to provide you with meaningful data on the places, people, and things that help you find happiness.<br><br>*About Us<br>We designed Happyfeed to be a simple way to be grateful each day and build a happy feed of all the best moments in your life. Each feature in Happyfeed is intended to follow best-practices from positive psychology research - so your time is well spent. It&#39;s a simple habit that can make a real, positive change on your mood and become a more mindful person :)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Happyfeed is a daily gratitude journal app that helps you focus on the bright side by reflecting on positive moments or gratitudes each day. Create a journal, or &quot;happy feed,&quot; of positive memories you&#39;ll love to explore while training your brain to express gratitude, feel more grateful in life, and become more resilient. <br><br>\u2022 Add photos and locations (optionally) to your posts<br>\u2022 Daily happy memories from your journal weeks to years ago<br>\u2022 Join a Pod to share progress and select moments in small groups<br>\u2022 Custom prompts - reminders, quotes, and fun facts each day<br>\u2022 Tag your best days with an emoji<br>\u2022 Free, unlimited posting forever<br>\u2022 Fully private: only optional sharing with Pods<br><br>*Explore Your Happy Memories<br>After your first week, you\u2019ll be able to hop back to memories from your gratitude journal exactly a week ago. This period grows from weeks to years and becomes another source of happiness throughout your day.<br><br>*Pods: Journaling Together<br>Pods are small, private groups where you can share your journaling progress and favorite moments. It&#39;s a place to connect with your friends, your partner, your family, or anyone. Imagine a feed of only personalized, happy moments - that&#39;s Pods!<br><br>*Unique Reminders Daily<br>Every day our team writes a custom daily reminder to help you remember to enter your moments. This could be a quote about happiness, a fact about this day in history, or just a fun little joke to try and brighten up your day.<br><br>*Happiness Jar<br>After your second week of recording moments on Happyfeed, you&#39;ll be able to use the Happiness Jar to view a random past day and all your positive memories. It&#39;s a fun way to boost your mood and feel a little more thankful every day. <br><br>*Benefits of Gratitude Journaling<br>Keeping a gratitude journal is an effective practice in helping to reduce stress and anxiety while improving your overall happiness. It&#39;s as simple as writing down 3 good things each day (or night). Especially in tough times, the practice of actively reflecting on what you are thankful for can help you refocus your thoughts on the positive. Recording what you are grateful is a proven self-care technique with proven benefits by positive psychology.<br><br>*Sync On All Your Devices<br>We also offer a web version where you can upload and view your past moments - just check out our website after signing up. Your moments and photos are privately synced to your account so you\u2019ll never lose them. Just another reason to be thankful!<br><br>*Private &amp; Secure<br>Your moments are only visible to you and never posted publicly. All cloud syncing is securely encrypted using HTTPS endpoints. <br><br>*Your Account<br>An account is required in order to keep your moments safe and to allow you to view and manage them across multiple devices. If you lose your device, you won\u2019t lose all your happy memories. You may choose to share your location to provide you with meaningful data on the places, people, and things that help you find happiness.<br><br>*About Us<br>We designed Happyfeed to be a simple way to be grateful each day and build a happy feed of all the best moments in your life. Each feature in Happyfeed is intended to follow best-practices from positive psychology research - so your time is well spent. It&#39;s a simple habit that can make a real, positive change on your mood and become a more mindful person :)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Happyfeed is a simple journal designed to improve your mental health by reflecting on gratitude and happy moments each day. Research shows that gratitude journaling can help you feel even 10% happier by teaching you to focus on the good things in life. You can also join a Pod to share your memories in a group, or keep things 100% private \ud83d\ude09<br><br>\u2022 Add photos and locations (optionally) to your posts<br>\u2022 Daily throwback memories after your first week<br>\u2022 Group sharing perfect for couples, friends &amp; family<br>\u2022 Custom prompts - reminders, quotes, and fun facts each day<br>\u2022 Tag your best days with an emoji<br>\u2022 Free, unlimited posting forever<br>\u2022 Fully private: only optional sharing with Pods<br><br>*Explore Your Happy Memories<br>After your first week, you\u2019ll be able to hop back to memories from your gratitude journal exactly a week ago. This period grows from weeks to years and becomes another source of happiness throughout your day.<br><br>*Pods: Journaling Together<br>Pods are private groups where you can share memories, photos, and journaling progress. You&#39;re also able to react to shared moments by sending emojis. It&#39;s a novel way to uplift and share joy with your friends, partner, family, or even coworkers. If you&#39;re looking for a shared journal, that&#39;s Pods! <br><br>*Unique Reminders Daily<br>Every day our team writes a custom daily reminder to help you remember to enter your moments. This could be a quote about happiness, a fact about this day in history, or just a fun little joke to try and brighten up your day.<br><br>*Happiness Jar<br>After your second week of recording moments on Happyfeed, you&#39;ll be able to use the Happiness Jar to view a random past day and all your positive memories. It&#39;s a fun way to boost your mood and feel a little more thankful every day. <br><br>*Benefits of Gratitude Journaling<br>Keeping a gratitude journal is an effective practice that can help to reduce stress and anxiety while improving your overall happiness. Some studies have shown it can make you even 10% happier. It&#39;s as simple as writing down 3 good things each day (or night). Especially in tough times, actively reflecting on what you are thankful for can help you refocus your thoughts on the positive. Recording what you are grateful is a proven self-care technique with proven benefits by positive psychology!<br><br>*Sync On All Your Devices<br>We also offer a web version where you can upload and view your past moments - just check out our website after signing up. Your moments and photos are privately synced to your account so you\u2019ll never lose them. Just another reason to be thankful!<br><br>*Private &amp; Secure<br>Your moments are only visible to you and never posted publicly. All cloud syncing is securely encrypted using HTTPS endpoints. <br><br>*Your Account<br>An account is required in order to keep your moments safe and to allow you to view and manage them across multiple devices. If you lose your device, you won\u2019t lose all your happy memories. You may choose to share your location to provide you with meaningful data on the places, people, and things that help you find happiness.<br><br>*About Us<br>We designed Happyfeed to be a simple way to be grateful each day and build a happy feed of all the best moments in your life. Each feature in Happyfeed is intended to follow best-practices from positive psychology research - so your time is well spent. It&#39;s a simple habit that can make a real, positive change on your mood and become a more mindful person :)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Happyfeed is a simple journal designed to improve your mental health by reflecting on gratitude and happy moments each day. Research shows that gratitude journaling can help you feel even 10% happier by teaching you to focus on the good things in life. You can also join a Pod to share your memories in a group, or keep things 100% private \ud83d\ude09<br><br>\u2022 Add photos and locations (optionally) to your posts<br>\u2022 Daily throwback memories after your first week<br>\u2022 Group sharing perfect for couples, friends &amp; family<br>\u2022 Custom prompts - reminders, quotes, and fun facts each day<br>\u2022 Tag your best days with an emoji<br>\u2022 Free, unlimited posting forever<br>\u2022 Fully private: only optional sharing with Pods<br><br>*Explore Your Happy Memories<br>After your first week, you\u2019ll be able to hop back to memories from your gratitude journal exactly a week ago. This period grows from weeks to years and becomes another source of happiness throughout your day.<br><br>*Pods: Journaling Together<br>Pods are private groups where you can share memories, photos, and journaling progress. You&#39;re also able to react to shared moments by sending emojis. It&#39;s a novel way to uplift and share joy with your friends, partner, family, or even coworkers. If you&#39;re looking for a shared journal, that&#39;s Pods! <br><br>*Unique Reminders Daily<br>Every day our team writes a custom daily reminder to help you remember to enter your moments. This could be a quote about happiness, a fact about this day in history, or just a fun little joke to try and brighten up your day.<br><br>*Happiness Jar<br>After your second week of recording moments on Happyfeed, you&#39;ll be able to use the Happiness Jar to view a random past day and all your positive memories. It&#39;s a fun way to boost your mood and feel a little more thankful every day. <br><br>*Benefits of Gratitude Journaling<br>Keeping a gratitude journal is an effective practice that can help to reduce stress and anxiety while improving your overall happiness. Some studies have shown it can make you even 10% happier. It&#39;s as simple as writing down 3 good things each day (or night). Especially in tough times, actively reflecting on what you are thankful for can help you refocus your thoughts on the positive. Recording what you are grateful is a proven self-care technique with proven benefits by positive psychology!<br><br>*Sync On All Your Devices<br>We also offer a web version where you can upload and view your past moments - just check out our website after signing up. Your moments and photos are privately synced to your account so you\u2019ll never lose them. Just another reason to be thankful!<br><br>*Private &amp; Secure<br>Your moments are only visible to you and never posted publicly. All cloud syncing is securely encrypted using HTTPS endpoints. <br><br>*Your Account<br>An account is required in order to keep your moments safe and to allow you to view and manage them across multiple devices. If you lose your device, you won\u2019t lose all your happy memories. You may choose to share your location to provide you with meaningful data on the places, people, and things that help you find happiness.<br><br>*About Us<br>We designed Happyfeed to be a simple way to be grateful each day and build a happy feed of all the best moments in your life. Each feature in Happyfeed is intended to follow best-practices from positive psychology research - so your time is well spent. It&#39;s a simple habit that can make a real, positive change on your mood and become a more mindful person :)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Happyfeed is a simple journal designed to improve your mental health by reflecting on gratitude and happy moments each day. Research shows that gratitude journaling can help you feel even 10% happier by teaching you to focus on the good things in life. You can also join a Pod to share your memories in a group, or keep things 100% private \ud83d\ude09<br><br>\u2022 Add photos and locations (optionally) to your posts<br>\u2022 Daily throwback memories after your first week<br>\u2022 Group sharing perfect for couples, friends &amp; family<br>\u2022 Custom prompts - reminders, quotes, and fun facts each day<br>\u2022 Tag your best days with an emoji<br>\u2022 Free, unlimited posting forever<br>\u2022 Fully private: only optional sharing with Pods<br><br>*Explore Your Happy Memories<br>After your first week, you\u2019ll be able to hop back to memories from your gratitude journal exactly a week ago. This period grows from weeks to years and becomes another source of happiness throughout your day.<br><br>*Pods: Journaling Together<br>Pods are private groups where you can share memories, photos, and journaling progress. You&#39;re also able to react to shared moments by sending emojis. It&#39;s a novel way to uplift and share joy with your friends, partner, family, or even coworkers. If you&#39;re looking for a shared journal, that&#39;s Pods! <br><br>*Unique Reminders Daily<br>Every day our team writes a custom daily reminder to help you remember to enter your moments. This could be a quote about happiness, a fact about this day in history, or just a fun little joke to try and brighten up your day.<br><br>*Happiness Jar<br>After your second week of recording moments on Happyfeed, you&#39;ll be able to use the Happiness Jar to view a random past day and all your positive memories. It&#39;s a fun way to boost your mood and feel a little more thankful every day. <br><br>*Benefits of Gratitude Journaling<br>Keeping a gratitude journal is an effective practice that can help to reduce stress and anxiety while improving your overall happiness. Some studies have shown it can make you even 10% happier. It&#39;s as simple as writing down 3 good things each day (or night). Especially in tough times, actively reflecting on what you are thankful for can help you refocus your thoughts on the positive. Recording what you are grateful is a proven self-care technique with proven benefits by positive psychology!<br><br>*Sync On All Your Devices<br>We also offer a web version where you can upload and view your past moments - just check out our website after signing up. Your moments and photos are privately synced to your account so you\u2019ll never lose them. Just another reason to be thankful!<br><br>*Private &amp; Secure<br>Your moments are only visible to you and never posted publicly. All cloud syncing is securely encrypted using HTTPS endpoints. <br><br>*Your Account<br>An account is required in order to keep your moments safe and to allow you to view and manage them across multiple devices. If you lose your device, you won\u2019t lose all your happy memories. You may choose to share your location to provide you with meaningful data on the places, people, and things that help you find happiness.<br><br>*About Us<br>We designed Happyfeed to be a simple way to be grateful each day and build a happy feed of all the best moments in your life. Each feature in Happyfeed is intended to follow best-practices from positive psychology research - so your time is well spent. It&#39;s a simple habit that can make a real, positive change on your mood and become a more mindful person :)",

    "descriptionHtml": "Happyfeed is a simple journal designed to improve your mental health by reflecting on gratitude and happy moments each day. Research shows that gratitude journaling can help you feel even 10% happier by teaching you to focus on the good things in life. You can also join a Pod to share your memories in a group, or keep things 100% private \ud83d\ude09<br><br>\u2022 Add photos and locations (optionally) to your posts<br>\u2022 Daily throwback memories after your first week<br>\u2022 Group sharing perfect for couples, friends &amp; family<br>\u2022 Custom prompts - reminders, quotes, and fun facts each day<br>\u2022 Tag your best days with an emoji<br>\u2022 Free, unlimited posting forever<br>\u2022 Fully private: only optional sharing with Pods<br><br>*Explore Your Happy Memories<br>After your first week, you\u2019ll be able to hop back to memories from your gratitude journal exactly a week ago. This period grows from weeks to years and becomes another source of happiness throughout your day.<br><br>*Pods: Journaling Together<br>Pods are private groups where you can share memories, photos, and journaling progress. You&#39;re also able to react to shared moments by sending emojis. It&#39;s a novel way to uplift and share joy with your friends, partner, family, or even coworkers. If you&#39;re looking for a shared journal, that&#39;s Pods! <br><br>*Unique Reminders Daily<br>Every day our team writes a custom daily reminder to help you remember to enter your moments. This could be a quote about happiness, a fact about this day in history, or just a fun little joke to try and brighten up your day.<br><br>*Happiness Jar<br>After your second week of recording moments on Happyfeed, you&#39;ll be able to use the Happiness Jar to view a random past day and all your positive memories. It&#39;s a fun way to boost your mood and feel a little more thankful every day. <br><br>*Benefits of Gratitude Journaling<br>Keeping a gratitude journal is an effective practice that can help to reduce stress and anxiety while improving your overall happiness. Some studies have shown it can make you even 10% happier. It&#39;s as simple as writing down 3 good things each day (or night). Especially in tough times, actively reflecting on what you are thankful for can help you refocus your thoughts on the positive. Recording what you are grateful is a proven self-care technique with proven benefits by positive psychology!<br><br>*Sync On All Your Devices<br>We also offer a web version where you can upload and view your past moments - just check out our website after signing up. Your moments and photos are privately synced to your account so you\u2019ll never lose them. Just another reason to be thankful!<br><br>*Private &amp; Secure<br>Your moments are only visible to you and never posted publicly. All cloud syncing is securely encrypted using HTTPS endpoints. <br><br>*Your Account<br>An account is required in order to keep your moments safe and to allow you to view and manage them across multiple devices. If you lose your device, you won\u2019t lose all your happy memories. You may choose to share your location to provide you with meaningful data on the places, people, and things that help you find happiness.<br><br>*About Us<br>We designed Happyfeed to be a simple way to be grateful each day and build a happy feed of all the best moments in your life. Each feature in Happyfeed is intended to follow best-practices from positive psychology research - so your time is well spent. It&#39;s a simple habit that can make a real, positive change on your mood and become a more mindful person :)",

With users being the most valuable asset, we prioritizes in providing a safe environment for them, leading to a comprehensive operation of the following three items from dedicated Azar Team.<br><br>- User ecosystem: We&#39;re establishing a virtuous cycle among users by providing an easy reporting system which pops up prior to any abusive actions and compensating users for reporting.<br><br>- Heuristic monitoring: Hundreds of agents perform 24-hour monitoring and work towards solving problems raised by users with unpleasant experience, in the shortest time possible. To best protect users&#39; privacy, the agents are not monitoring the matches directly.<br><br>- Technology-based user management: With machine learning technology, any inappropriate images are being filtered out prior to getting matched. Also, AI technology is used to protect passive users with hesitance to reporting. Since AI technology recognizes images on the screen without going through a server, it automatically questions the users who are likely to have had an unpleasant experience, in order to induce reports.<br><br>\u25b7 Other key features:<br>-  Add new people to your friends list and create meaningful connections<br>-  Use the history feature to find and resume chatting with previous connections<br>-  Don\u2019t be afraid of foreign languages!

To best protect users&#39; privacy, the agents are not monitoring the matches directly.<br><br>- Technology-based user management: With machine learning technology, any inappropriate images are being filtered out prior to getting matched. Also, AI technology is used to protect passive users with hesitance to reporting.

With users being the most valuable asset, we prioritizes in providing a safe environment for them, leading to a comprehensive operation of the following three items from dedicated Azar Team.<br><br>- User ecosystem: We&#39;re establishing a virtuous cycle among users by providing an easy reporting system which pops up prior to any abusive actions and compensating users for reporting.<br><br>- Heuristic monitoring: Hundreds of agents perform 24-hour monitoring and work towards solving problems raised by users with unpleasant experience, in the shortest time possible. To best protect users&#39; privacy, the agents are not monitoring the matches directly.<br><br>- Technology-based user management: With machine learning technology, any inappropriate images are being filtered out prior to getting matched. Also, AI technology is used to protect passive users with hesitance to reporting.

With users being the most valuable asset, we prioritizes in providing a safe environment for them, leading to a comprehensive operation of the following three items from dedicated Azar Team.<br><br>- User ecosystem: We&#39;re establishing a virtuous cycle among users by providing an easy reporting system which pops up prior to any abusive actions and compensating users for reporting.<br><br>- Heuristic monitoring: Hundreds of agents perform 24-hour monitoring and work towards solving problems raised by users with unpleasant experience, in the shortest time possible. To best protect users&#39; privacy, the agents are not monitoring the matches directly.<br><br>- Technology-based user management: With machine learning technology, any inappropriate images are being filtered out prior to getting matched. Also, AI technology is used to protect passive users with hesitance to reporting.

To best protect users&#39; privacy, the agents are not monitoring the matches directly.<br><br>- Technology-based user management: With machine learning technology, any inappropriate images are being filtered out prior to getting matched. Also, AI technology is used to protect passive users with hesitance to reporting.

To best protect users&#39; privacy, the agents are not monitoring the matches directly.<br><br>- Technology-based user management: With machine learning technology, any inappropriate images are being filtered out prior to getting matched. Also, AI technology is used to protect passive users with hesitance to reporting. Since AI technology recognizes images on the screen without going through a server, it automatically questions the users who are likely to have had an unpleasant experience, in order to induce reports.<br><br>\u25b7 Other key features:<br>-  Add new people to your friends list and create meaningful connections<br>-  Use the history feature to find and resume chatting with previous connections<br>-  Don\u2019t be afraid of foreign languages!

To best protect users&#39; privacy, the agents are not monitoring the matches directly.<br><br>- Technology-based user management: With machine learning technology, any inappropriate images are being filtered out prior to getting matched. Also, AI technology is used to protect passive users with hesitance to reporting.

    "descriptionHtml": "Beyond Basics Fitness &amp; Nutrition is proudly working to build a fun, supportive, inclusive community of women getting fit and healthy together through online and in-person training and coaching. <br><br>Beyond Basics is helping busy women (and sometimes men) creating lasting change they never thought possible or had given up on. Many women have lost stubborn fat, reduced chronic pain, rehabilitated old injuries and have become fitter than ever before. However, nothing is more satisfying than seeing women learn to really enjoy exercise, look forward to their training sessions, and find confidence they never had or had lost somewhere along the way. We get these fabulous results with fun, safe and effective workouts and optional habit-based coaching. No gimmicks, no expensive equipment or supplements required.<br><br>At Beyond Basics, we believe that fitness looks good on everyone no matter your age, abilities, size, appearance or status, and that everyone deserves to get fit the way they see fit. <br><br>Beyond Basics Pro Trainer allows you to take a personal trainer with you wherever you go, and on YOUR time, offering you the most personalized online support available so you can build skills and confidence and reach your fitness and nutrition goals as quickly and safely as possible.<br><br>While you can&#39;t beat in-person training for learning proper form and fun accountability, not everyone can afford to train this way or has the luxury of committing to a specific, weekly schedule to meet with a trainer. You might love to hire a personal trainer but find it almost impossible to schedule sessions because of shift work, commute time, extensive travel or &quot;around the clock&quot; care of a dependent. <br><br>Beyond Basics Pro Trainer allows for more flexibility paired with in-person training, is a great next step after completing an in-person training program, or wonderful entirely on its own. <br><br>With Pro Trainer you can choose from a variety of options. Which of these program works for you? An online only group or personal training package, a combination of in-person and online training, or using the app as an add-on to your in-person training? <br>(Personal training packages come with a plan complete with fitness and postural assessments.) <br><br>Get the app and make this YOUR year to get fit, healthy, confident and happier, and have a lot of FUN doing it!<br><br>REAL LIFE. REAL SUPPORT. REAL RESULTS.<br><br>Certifications include:<br>Personal Trainer<br>Certified Online Trainer<br>Group Fitness Instructor<br>Indoor Cycling Instructor<br>Core de Force Instructor (MMA inspired workouts<br>Education in counselling including Level 1-4 Counselling Practicums<br><br>Currently working on:<br>Pre and Postnatal Coaching<br>Precision Nutrition Level 1 Certification<br>Certified Conditioning Coach",

    "descriptionHtml": "Beyond Basics Fitness &amp; Nutrition is proudly working to build a fun, supportive, inclusive community of women getting fit and healthy together through online and in-person training and coaching. <br><br>Beyond Basics is helping busy women (and sometimes men) creating lasting change they never thought possible or had given up on. Many women have lost stubborn fat, reduced chronic pain, rehabilitated old injuries and have become fitter than ever before. However, nothing is more satisfying than seeing women learn to really enjoy exercise, look forward to their training sessions, and find confidence they never had or had lost somewhere along the way. We get these fabulous results with fun, safe and effective workouts and optional habit-based coaching. No gimmicks, no expensive equipment or supplements required.<br><br>At Beyond Basics, we believe that fitness looks good on everyone no matter your age, abilities, size, appearance or status, and that everyone deserves to get fit the way they see fit. <br><br>Beyond Basics Pro Trainer allows you to take a personal trainer with you wherever you go, and on YOUR time, offering you the most personalized online support available so you can build skills and confidence and reach your fitness and nutrition goals as quickly and safely as possible.<br><br>While you can&#39;t beat in-person training for learning proper form and fun accountability, not everyone can afford to train this way or has the luxury of committing to a specific, weekly schedule to meet with a trainer. You might love to hire a personal trainer but find it almost impossible to schedule sessions because of shift work, commute time, extensive travel or &quot;around the clock&quot; care of a dependent. <br><br>Beyond Basics Pro Trainer allows for more flexibility paired with in-person training, is a great next step after completing an in-person training program, or wonderful entirely on its own. <br><br>With Pro Trainer you can choose from a variety of options. Which of these program works for you? An online only group or personal training package, a combination of in-person and online training, or using the app as an add-on to your in-person training? <br>(Personal training packages come with a plan complete with fitness and postural assessments.) <br><br>Get the app and make this YOUR year to get fit, healthy, confident and happier, and have a lot of FUN doing it!<br><br>REAL LIFE. REAL SUPPORT. REAL RESULTS.<br><br>Certifications include:<br>Personal Trainer<br>Certified Online Trainer<br>Group Fitness Instructor<br>Indoor Cycling Instructor<br>Core de Force Instructor (MMA inspired workouts<br>Education in counselling including Level 1-4 Counselling Practicums<br><br>Currently working on:<br>Pre and Postnatal Coaching<br>Precision Nutrition Level 1 Certification<br>Certified Conditioning Coach",

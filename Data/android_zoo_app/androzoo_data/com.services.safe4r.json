    "descriptionHtml": "What is a first responder?  It should be defined as whoever can get to someone in crises FIRST.  Today when in crises, we call 911 and wait and hope that they can reach us quickly.  But did you know that the average response time for police to get to an emergency is 10 minutes and for EMS its 15 minutes.  Have you ever looked at the process that is required to get an Amber Alert activated? <br><br>These kinds of delay can be the difference between life and death.                                                                                                    The reality is that the process that is required to get traditional first responders activated have been around for decades, and are processes that were put in place long prior to the invention of the most prolific and expansive network the world has ever seen....Social Media.  <br><br>It&#39;s time for a change in how we take advantage of this incredible and immediate reach.                                                                                                                                             If someone you love or care about had a medical or safety crises how many people would you hope could be there to help them?  How quickly would you want a responder to be able to get to them to provide assistance, even if its just to witness what was happening?  <br><br>SAFE4R is the worlds first social protection application that creates a massive Safety Net of ordinary people who become witnesses and first responders for medical emergencies or for any situation that makes a user or their loved ones feel like their safety may be in jeopardy.  The incredible features of this application help to assure that no matter the situation, you and your loved ones will be SAFE4R than ever before.   The reality is that there is a major problem going on even beyond the massive numbers of medical emergencies that are encountered daily.  With things like life altering encounters with law enforcement, sex trafficking, kidnappings and the list goes on and on, this is the one application that you should absolutely demand that everyone you care about installs on their mobile devices so that if they are in a situation that they feel needs witnesses or responders, they know that potentially hundreds or thousands of people can be there for them.",

    "descriptionHtml": "What is a first responder?  It should be defined as whoever can get to someone in crises FIRST.  Today when in crises, we call 911 and wait and hope that they can reach us quickly.  But did you know that the average response time for police to get to an emergency is 10 minutes and for EMS its 15 minutes.  Have you ever looked at the process that is required to get an Amber Alert activated? <br><br>These kinds of delay can be the difference between life and death.                                                                                                    The reality is that the process that is required to get traditional first responders activated have been around for decades, and are processes that were put in place long prior to the invention of the most prolific and expansive network the world has ever seen....Social Media.  <br><br>It&#39;s time for a change in how we take advantage of this incredible and immediate reach.                                                                                                                                             If someone you love or care about had a medical or safety crises how many people would you hope could be there to help them?  How quickly would you want a responder to be able to get to them to provide assistance, even if its just to witness what was happening?  <br><br>SAFE4R is the worlds first social protection application that creates a massive Safety Net of ordinary people who become witnesses and first responders for medical emergencies or for any situation that makes a user or their loved ones feel like their safety may be in jeopardy.  The incredible features of this application help to assure that no matter the situation, you and your loved ones will be SAFE4R than ever before.   The reality is that there is a major problem going on even beyond the massive numbers of medical emergencies that are encountered daily.  With things like life altering encounters with law enforcement, sex trafficking, kidnappings and the list goes on and on, this is the one application that you should absolutely demand that everyone you care about installs on their mobile devices so that if they are in a situation that they feel needs witnesses or responders, they know that potentially hundreds or thousands of people can be there for them.",

    "descriptionHtml": "What is a first responder?  It should be defined as whoever can get to someone in crises FIRST.  Today when in crises, we call 911 and wait and hope that they can reach us quickly.  But did you know that the average response time for police to get to an emergency is 10 minutes and for EMS its 15 minutes.  Have you ever looked at the process that is required to get an Amber Alert activated? <br><br>These kinds of delay can be the difference between life and death.                                                                                                    The reality is that the process that is required to get traditional first responders activated have been around for decades, and are processes that were put in place long prior to the invention of the most prolific and expansive network the world has ever seen....Social Media.  <br><br>It&#39;s time for a change in how we take advantage of this incredible and immediate reach.                                                                                                                                             If someone you love or care about had a medical or safety crises how many people would you hope could be there to help them?  How quickly would you want a responder to be able to get to them to provide assistance, even if its just to witness what was happening?  <br><br>SAFE4R is the worlds first social protection application that creates a massive Safety Net of ordinary people who become witnesses and first responders for medical emergencies or for any situation that makes a user or their loved ones feel like their safety may be in jeopardy.  The incredible features of this application help to assure that no matter the situation, you and your loved ones will be SAFE4R than ever before.   The reality is that there is a major problem going on even beyond the massive numbers of medical emergencies that are encountered daily.  With things like life altering encounters with law enforcement, sex trafficking, kidnappings and the list goes on and on, this is the one application that you should absolutely demand that everyone you care about installs on their mobile devices so that if they are in a situation that they feel needs witnesses or responders, they know that potentially hundreds or thousands of people can be there for them.",

    "descriptionHtml": "What is a first responder?  It should be defined as whoever can get to someone in crises FIRST.  Today when in crises, we call 911 and wait and hope that they can reach us quickly.  But did you know that the average response time for police to get to an emergency is 10 minutes and for EMS its 15 minutes.  Have you ever looked at the process that is required to get an Amber Alert activated? <br><br>These kinds of delay can be the difference between life and death.                                                                                                    The reality is that the process that is required to get traditional first responders activated have been around for decades, and are processes that were put in place long prior to the invention of the most prolific and expansive network the world has ever seen....Social Media.  <br><br>It&#39;s time for a change in how we take advantage of this incredible and immediate reach.                                                                                                                                             If someone you love or care about had a medical or safety crises how many people would you hope could be there to help them?  How quickly would you want a responder to be able to get to them to provide assistance, even if its just to witness what was happening?  <br><br>SAFE4R is the worlds first social protection application that creates a massive Safety Net of ordinary people who become witnesses and first responders for medical emergencies or for any situation that makes a user or their loved ones feel like their safety may be in jeopardy.  The incredible features of this application help to assure that no matter the situation, you and your loved ones will be SAFE4R than ever before.   The reality is that there is a major problem going on even beyond the massive numbers of medical emergencies that are encountered daily.  With things like life altering encounters with law enforcement, sex trafficking, kidnappings and the list goes on and on, this is the one application that you should absolutely demand that everyone you care about installs on their mobile devices so that if they are in a situation that they feel needs witnesses or responders, they know that potentially hundreds or thousands of people can be there for them.",

Today when in crises, we call 911 and wait and hope that they can reach us quickly.  But did you know that the average response time for police to get to an emergency is 10 minutes and for EMS its 15 minutes.  Have you ever looked at the process that is required to get an Amber Alert activated? <br><br>These kinds of delay can be the difference between life and death.                                                                                                    The reality is that the process that is required to get traditional first responders activated have been around for decades, and are processes that were put in place long prior to the invention of the most prolific and expansive network the world has ever seen....Social Media.  <br><br>It&#39;s time for a change in how we take advantage of this incredible and immediate reach.

How quickly would you want a responder to be able to get to them to provide assistance, even if its just to witness what was happening?  <br><br>SAFE4R is the worlds first social protection application that creates a massive Safety Net of ordinary people who become witnesses and first responders for medical emergencies or for any situation that makes a user or their loved ones feel like their safety may be in jeopardy.

The reality is that there is a major problem going on even beyond the massive numbers of medical emergencies that are encountered daily.  With things like life altering encounters with law enforcement, sex trafficking, kidnappings and the list goes on and on, this is the one application that you should absolutely demand that everyone you care about installs on their mobile devices so that if they are in a situation that they feel needs witnesses or responders, they know that potentially hundreds or thousands of people can be there for them.",

    "descriptionHtml": "What is a first responder?  It should be defined as whoever can get to someone in crises FIRST.  Today when in crises, we call 911 and wait and hope that they can reach us quickly.  But did you know that the average response time for police to get to an emergency is 10 minutes and for EMS its 15 minutes.  Have you ever looked at the process that is required to get an Amber Alert activated? <br><br>These kinds of delay can be the difference between life and death.                                                                                                    The reality is that the process that is required to get traditional first responders activated have been around for decades, and are processes that were put in place long prior to the invention of the most prolific and expansive network the world has ever seen....Social Media.  <br><br>It&#39;s time for a change in how we take advantage of this incredible and immediate reach.                                                                                                                                             If someone you love or care about had a medical or safety crises how many people would you hope could be there to help them?  How quickly would you want a responder to be able to get to them to provide assistance, even if its just to witness what was happening?  <br><br>SAFE4R is the worlds first social protection application that creates a massive Safety Net of ordinary people who become witnesses and first responders for medical emergencies or for any situation that makes a user or their loved ones feel like their safety may be in jeopardy.  The incredible features of this application help to assure that no matter the situation, you and your loved ones will be SAFE4R than ever before.   The reality is that there is a major problem going on even beyond the massive numbers of medical emergencies that are encountered daily.  With things like life altering encounters with law enforcement, sex trafficking, kidnappings and the list goes on and on, this is the one application that you should absolutely demand that everyone you care about installs on their mobile devices so that if they are in a situation that they feel needs witnesses or responders, they know that potentially hundreds or thousands of people can be there for them.",

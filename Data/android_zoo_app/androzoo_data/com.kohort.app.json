We help you share photos, stay better connected, organize activities and streamline communication. Say goodbye to endless email threads and mysterious group texts. Kohort simplifies all of this while your keeping your conversations private.<br><br>Kohort is also the simple solution for affinity groups such as teams, communities, clubs, associations, faith groups and more. These are groups of people who are in regular contact with each other, sharing valuable information and setting up events. With Kohort, you can have all your peeps in one place. Imagine your family, school association, pickup league, and book club all in one app. It\u2019s now possible with Kohort. <br><br>Here are just a few types of groups using Kohort today:<br><br>Sports Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with sports teams like schedule, gameday duties, directions to the game and player availability. But Kohort is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer and hoop groups when all you care about is whether you have enough players to field a game.<br><br>Family<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those family moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. And in between, Kohort ensures you\u2019re on top of birthdays, graduations and anniversaries.<br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with Kohort. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a mobile solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it is easier to access.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your house of worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through Kohort. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need and more. <br><br>Kohort also offers advanced features that you can geek out on for the engineer in all of us. Here\u2019s a few of our favorites:<br><br>Shared Photo Albums<br><br>Task Lists<br><br>Subgroups and Sister Groups<br><br>Personal Chat and Group Chat<br><br>Advanced Member Management <br><br>Rosters, Schedules, and Player Availability for Teams<br><br>Reviews, Ratings, and Meetings for Bookclubs<br><br>Mass Communications (Email, Push Notifications, In-App Alerts)<br><br>And lots more...<br><br>About Kohort<br>Guided by a commitment to ethical tech and social responsibility, Kohort is a privacy-first network. On the simplest level, we\u2019re a photo-sharing feed for family and friends. On a more sophisticated level, we\u2019re a group management platform that offers a robust suite of features that save time and headache for any group leader looking to stay better connected with less email. <br><br>We have a freemium subscription-based model so we have no incentive to keep you glued to your screen.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br> <br>At Kohort, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than Kohort. Start building your supergroup today.<br> <br>Here\u2019s a few groups using Kohort today:\t\t<br> <br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, Kohort ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with Kohort. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br> <br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, Kohort\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br> <br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But Kohort is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through Kohort. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br> <br>Kohort also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br> <br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management <br><br>And much more\u2026<br> <br>About Kohort<br>Kohort is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, Kohort was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br> <br>In a world where everyone is vying for your attention, we believe there\u2019s a better way to connect and your communications shouldn\u2019t weigh you down. Kohort was designed so you can check in, check out, and get back to your regularly scheduled life. We\u2019re social catalysts, not the endgame.<br> <br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival Kohort in purpose and design. <br> <br>Kohort",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br> <br>At Kohort, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than Kohort. Start building your supergroup today.<br> <br>Here\u2019s a few groups using Kohort today:\t\t<br> <br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, Kohort ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with Kohort. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br> <br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, Kohort\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br> <br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But Kohort is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through Kohort. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br> <br>Kohort also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br> <br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management <br><br>And much more\u2026<br> <br>About Kohort<br>Kohort is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, Kohort was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br> <br>In a world where everyone is vying for your attention, we believe there\u2019s a better way to connect and your communications shouldn\u2019t weigh you down. Kohort was designed so you can check in, check out, and get back to your regularly scheduled life. We\u2019re social catalysts, not the endgame.<br> <br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival Kohort in purpose and design. <br> <br>Kohort",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br> <br>At Kohort, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than Kohort. Start building your supergroup today.<br> <br>Here\u2019s a few groups using Kohort today:\t\t<br> <br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, Kohort ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with Kohort. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br> <br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, Kohort\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br> <br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But Kohort is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through Kohort. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br> <br>Kohort also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br> <br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management <br><br>And much more\u2026<br> <br>About Kohort<br>Kohort is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, Kohort was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br> <br>In a world where everyone is vying for your attention, we believe there\u2019s a better way to connect and your communications shouldn\u2019t weigh you down. Kohort was designed so you can check in, check out, and get back to your regularly scheduled life. We\u2019re social catalysts, not the endgame.<br> <br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival Kohort in purpose and design. <br> <br>Kohort",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br> <br>At Kohort, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than Kohort. Start building your supergroup today.<br> <br>Here\u2019s a few groups using Kohort today:\t\t<br> <br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, Kohort ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with Kohort. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br> <br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, Kohort\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br> <br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But Kohort is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through Kohort. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br> <br>Kohort also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br> <br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management <br><br>And much more\u2026<br> <br>About Kohort<br>Kohort is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, Kohort was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br> <br>In a world where everyone is vying for your attention, we believe there\u2019s a better way to connect and your communications shouldn\u2019t weigh you down. Kohort was designed so you can check in, check out, and get back to your regularly scheduled life. We\u2019re social catalysts, not the endgame.<br> <br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival Kohort in purpose and design. <br> <br>Kohort",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate.

Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages.

Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline.

Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline.

Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game.

    "descriptionHtml": "Getting together should be fun, not a headache. Don\u2019t let your communications weigh you down. Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability.

Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space.

We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion.

    "descriptionHtml": "Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game.

It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot.

But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space.

    "descriptionHtml": "Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space.

    "descriptionHtml": "Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot.

It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion.

    "descriptionHtml": "Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space.

    "descriptionHtml": "Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

    "descriptionHtml": "Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability.

    "descriptionHtml": "Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are overwhelming. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.<br><br>GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: <br><br>\u2022 Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts<br>\u2022 Personal and Group Chat<br>\u2022 Shared Photo Albums<br>\u2022 Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments<br>\u2022 Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams<br>\u2022 Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs<br>\u2022 Advanced Member Management<br>\u2022 Subgroups and Sister Group Management<br><br>And much more\u2026<br><br>About GroupSpot<br>GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you\u2019ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there\u2019s no incentive to mine someone\u2019s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.<br><br>We\u2019ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.<br><br>GroupSpot",

It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.<br><br>At GroupSpot, we\u2019ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single app solution, whether it\u2019s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won\u2019t find a platform with more flexibility and security than GroupSpot. Start building your supergroup today.<br><br>Here\u2019s a few groups using GroupSpot today:<br><br>Families<br>Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad\u2019s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you\u2019re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.<br> <br><br>Community Groups<br>Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it\u2019s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.<br><br>Book Clubs<br>Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot\u2019s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We\u2019ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.<br><br>Teams<br>We provide all the bells and whistles you\u2019ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.<br><br>Faith Groups<br>Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot.

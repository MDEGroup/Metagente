# Project Title

This repository contains the source code, datasets, and results for the experiments described in our paper. The structure of the project is as follows:

## Project Structure

### Data
This folder contains the input datasets used in the experiments.

- **ES.csv**: Main dataset used for the experiments.  
- **TS10.csv**: Subset of the dataset used for testing with 10 samples.  
- **TS50.csv**: Subset of the dataset used for testing with 50 samples.  

### Results
This folder contains the outputs generated during the experiments.

- **GITSUM_TS10.txt**: Results generated by the GITSUM model for the TS10 dataset.  
- **GITSUM_TS50.txt**: Results generated by the GITSUM model for the TS50 dataset.  
- **LLAMA_TS10.csv**: Summary results from the LLAMA model for the TS10 dataset.  
- **LLAMA_TS50.csv**: Summary results from the LLAMA model for the TS50 dataset.  

### Tools
This folder contains the Python scripts used to run the experiments and generate results.

- **GITSUM.py**: Script for running the GITSUM model on the datasets.  
- **LLAMA_SUMMARY.py**: Script for processing and summarizing results from the LLAMA model.  

## Usage Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**  
   Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. Install the dependencies using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Running the Experiments**  
   - To run the GITSUM model, execute:
     ```bash
     python Tools/GITSUM.py
     ```
   - To generate summaries using the LLAMA model, execute:
     ```bash
     python Tools/LLAMA_SUMMARY.py
     ```

3. **Datasets**  
   Place your datasets in the `Data` folder if you want to use custom data.

4. **Results**  
   Generated results will be stored in the `Results` folder for easy access.

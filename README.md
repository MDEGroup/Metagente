# Metagente

This repository contains the source code implementation of metagente and the datasets used to replicate the experimental results

## Getting Started

## Dependencies

* Python version 3.10.12
* Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`
* MongoDB

## Running the application

Installing necessary packages:
```Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the optimization code:
```Python
python main.py
--train_data_file data/train_data.csv
--train_result_dir result/train
```

Running the evaluation code:
```Python
python evaluation.py
--test_data_file data/test_data.csv
--test_result_dir result/test
```
# Repositories structure
This repository contains the source code, datasets, and results for the experiments described in our paper. The structure of the project is as follows:

### Data
This folder contains the input datasets used in the experiments.

- **ES.csv**: Main dataset used for the experiments.  
- **TS10.csv**: Subset of the dataset used for testing with 10 samples.  
- **TS50.csv**: Subset of the dataset used for testing with 50 samples.  

### Results
This folder contains the outputs generated during the experiments.

- **GITSUM_TS10.txt**: Results generated by the GITSUM model for the TS10 dataset.  
- **GITSUM_TS50.txt**: Results generated by the GITSUM model for the TS50 dataset.  
- **LLAMA_TS10.csv**: Summary results from the LLAMA model for the TS10 dataset.  
- **LLAMA_TS50.csv**: Summary results from the LLAMA model for the TS50 dataset. 
- **METAGENTE**: This folder contains parallel and sequential results from metagente for TS10 dataset.

### Tools
This folder contains the Python scripts used to run the experiments and generate results.
